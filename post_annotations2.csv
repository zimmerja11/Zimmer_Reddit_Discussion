I also have a passion for de-stigmatizing therapy, challenging therapeutic cliches, and breaking down barriers to seeking out treatment. Let's chat! AmA!","Hello!
 
 My name is Ryan, but I go by Dr\_Mick in online spaces. I'm a marriage and family therapist in the state of Illinois in the United States. I have a PhD in human development and a MS in marriage and family therapy. I am also an approved supervisor and a clinical lecturer of psychology at a local university. 
 
 My clinical specialty includes working with all types of anxiety, with couples, and with clients who play video games. I also write academically about video gaming's impact on individuals and relationships.
 
 I'm passionate about de-stigmatizing therapy, and about challenging assumptions about therapists. Therapists should be approachable and relatable - after all, we are people too!

 Relatedly - I recently combined my love of video games with my desire to help people find a starting point for accessing mental health resources and support by hosting a Twitch channel titled *\[Game\] Sessions with a Therapist.* Though I cannot ethically provide therapy services on my stream channel, I can (and do) answer general questions, provide general guidance, help find resources, as well as talk about all sorts of things from anxiety to depression to relationship health and more. My goal is to build a community where people can feel supported by me and other viewers, and where they can chat in a space that's more accessible and relatable.
 
 I stream nightly at 11:30pm CDT but also at other random times during the week if I get the time. **If you've ever wanted the opportunity to talk to a therapist in a more casual environment, stop by - I'd love to chat with you!**

And if you'd like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!
 
 **A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It'll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I've received:**
 
 1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there's some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a ""pro bono"" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.
 2. **How do I get over \[x\] or handle my \[x\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.
 3. **How do I convince \[x\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you're a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot ""force"" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)
 4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you're interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)
 5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it's a group of people who have been wanting the space. I'm truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it's something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It's something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.
 6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple  &  family therapist is my recommendation. If you're interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!
 7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick's and others' writings about video gaming?** I don't have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel's Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It's also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.
 8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you'd like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!
 
 Unfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I've received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It's for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don't feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.
 
 I'm still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you'd like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I'm on (pretty much) every night!

 Is there life out there, beyond the edge of our solar system? Are we alone? People from all walks of life have pondered those questions. For decades, NASA has lead the charge in finding out. Astrobiologists”scientists who study how life could live on other planets”search for clues in acidic lakes, deep under ice, or at searing hot hydrothermal vents in the ocean. They also think about what signs of life could look like on other worlds, including planets in our own solar system and exoplanets, which are planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. These signs are called biosignatures, and include things like certain types of molecules or traces left in a rock.
  
 At the same time, other scientists have pioneered a different kind of search for life. These scientists look for signs of intelligent life who might be trying to reach out to others in the galaxy with radio or laser transmissions. These signs are called technosignatures. Other types of technosignatures include evidence of pollutants in an exoplanet atmosphere or signs of an extraterrestrial structure around an exoplanet or star.
  
 We're a group of scientists who study astrobiology, exoplanets (including potentially habitable ones!) and potential technosignatures, and we're here to answer your questions about this exciting field! We'll be online starting at 1:00 p.m. EDT and we will sign our answers with our names or initials.

Chances are that won't play outside of Korea, so [here's](https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=ur60K_1537841889) a recording of a recording.
 
 I'm not alone, though! There are others from Australia, Vietnam, and we're eagerly expecting another Filipina storyteller to join us in a few hours. We've been here for three weeks now, and the program runs for the full month of September. Aren't we [stylish](https://i.imgur.com/sXVD3Vf.jpg)?
 
 The region Sachon is based in is called Gyeongsangbuk-do. Despite having some of the country's more populated cities, people have been leaving the area for several years, and there's real concern that some villages are going to just vanish off the map entirely.
 
 Several local schools in Sachon have closed and been reopened as community centers, there are currently 12 students in the whole village, down from a high of 1,000. The reasons for this are the same reasons for population crashes in other industrialized Asian countries, the cost of educating a child in such a competitive environment have skyrocketed beyond the reach of most families, so people are putting off marriage and child-rearing for economic concerns.
 
 One of the hopes for attracting international storytellers is to have them work a few hours each week educating area students, which should attract young parents to the village. The average age of the village is getting very near 50, without an influx of new blood there's the very real possibility that Sachon will become a literal ghost town.
 
 The regional government has actually been extremely active in preventing this, in years past they have helped construct two museums celebrating the history of the area, both as an agricultural powerhouse and as a hotbed of resistance against the Japanese occupation during the Imjin war. The house I'm staying in is actually immediately adjacent to a beautiful museum celebrating the Uiseong Uibeong, the Uiseong Righteous Militia which was comprised largely of Confucian scholars.
 
 There are a LOT of Confucian schools in the area, and they're some of the most breathtakingly beautiful architecture I've ever seen. It's beyond gorgeous, like stepping onto the set of a historical drama. When it rains I keep expecting to see women in silk dresses gazing wistfully out across the horizon, but that's just because I'm a sucker for wistful gazes.

IAmA,"I made a documentary about millennials, Gen Z, and guns that made some surprising discoveries. AMA.","Hey, I'm Zach Toombs, a reporter and documentary producer for Newsy. Our latest report, Young Guns, looks at how millennials and Gen Z are buying, using, and thinking about guns very differently than older generations.
 

 
 We partnered with the polling firm Ipsos to conduct a survey that came up with some interesting findings, like:
 

 
 * American gun owners age 18-34 reported carrying a gun on them monthly almost twice as much as Gen X and Baby Boomers (43% to 23%)
 * Younger Americans were just as likely to own guns (28%) as older generations (27%)
 * Younger Americans' support for stricter gun control laws overall is higher than support from older Americans (61% versus 53% ” OK maybe that's not so surprising).
 

 
 Overall, our doc found that young gun owners are really into self-defense and concealed carry, even more than previous generations. That actually sort of makes sense when you look at larger trends (in 1999, way more people bought guns for hunting than for self-defense, but now that's flipped). As more states are opening up right-to-carry laws, that's meant more Americans are able to carry for self-defense. There's a lot of doubt from researchers over whether this actually makes anyone safer (many academics say it has the opposite effect). The doc gets into that too.

IAmA,I'm Paolo Cattaneo. I've been travelling solo on my motorcycle for the past 3 years. I've explored almost the totality of Australia and the Americas; heading now for the old continent. AmA !!,"Hey Reddit! 
 My name is Paolo. I'm 37yo and 3 years ago i quit my IT job in Australia and started travelling solo on my motorcycle.
 I haven't stop since.
 I spent a year roughly, going all around Australia and then i shipped my motorcycle to South America and started riding up from there. 
 I recently reached Alaska and came back to Vancouver, so now i'm planning my route towards Europe and across Asia to reach Australia again, to complete my round the world trip.
 I post one picture a day. 
 All my pictures are taken with my cellphone but I carry a drone as well.
 
 I've also been sponsored by some brands that sell motorcycle gear and equipment.
 I do NOT get paid to travel and i've been sustaining myself just with my savings, accumulated with few years of work.
 
 Before I left for this trip, I always wondered how people that did these kind of things (travelling for long periods of time) were actually able to do it. 
 So, here i am, hopefully answering some question and making myself useful in this sense for others that may have the same questions i had, before i started my journey.

IAmA,"I'm a 22 year old filmmaker and I've made three feature films and a webseries, all of which I've been releasing online for free. I want to redefine independent filmmaking for the modern age, with a direct connection between audience and filmmaker. Ask me anything!","Hello r/IAmA,
 

 
 My name is Joel Haver and I've made movies since I was six years old. This year I graduated from film school. Throughout schooling, I learned that my strong suit was conceptualizing ambitious projects and playing into my limitations to execute them for dirt cheap. This allowed me to make three features and a webseries during my vacations and free time, capitalizing on the creative safety net allowed by school. I had tested the waters with festival submissions and distributors, but given just how cheap I was able to make movies for, it felt dishonest to go through this old world rigmarole. In a day and age where anyone can film anything and post it online, calling anything independent that jumps through extraneous hoops just to be seen began to sound like a bad joke. To avoid that bad joke, I decided to double down on my strong suit, and cut out the middle men. The logical step was to release all my work for free, in hopes that it will find an audience online.
 

 
 Here's a little about my three features and webseries! Three of which are entirely viewable now for **free** and the fourth is releasing this weekend!
 

 
 # [We Are Sasquatch](https://vimeo.com/222848730)
 
 *We Are Sasquatch* is my first feature film, made for just $200 with my childhood friends and family in my hometown throughout the summer of 2016. It's a mockumentary about a small town dance contest in the 90's, set in a world where Sasquatches are just hairy people who have been assimilated into human society. As one might expect, tensions between the humans and Sasquatches boil.

 # [31 Days in Marshall, North Carolina](https://vimeo.com/286186006)
 
 In July 2017, my friend Dylan Dexter and I went to a town we had never been to, where we knew no one, and lived in a trailer for the entire month. We had no preconceived notions and no script. While there, we made a movie with the people we met. This summer, we returned to screen the film in Marshall and over 200 people showed up from a town with a population of 800. The experience from beginning to end was amazing and I hope the film can capture that.

 # [I'm Going to Be Famous](https://youtu.be/OMuDsueep9s)
 
 Easily my largest scale project to date, *I'm Going to Be Famous* consists of thirteen episodes shot over eight months and chronicles my real life journey to become famous before graduating college, by means of acting, stand up comedy, rapping, performance art and getting buff. This one is a real roller coaster that was constantly at the whim of the real world, if it seems like I'm just winging it then I probably was.

 # [Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself - Official Trailer](https://vimeo.com/287838929) - COMING SEPTEMBER 30TH
 
 *Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* marks my first time writing a feature length script! It tells the story of Bud, a clueless moron, whose relationship with his girlfriend Judith comes to an abrupt end and he has to learn to move on. Shot in my freetime throughout senior year, using equipment made available to me through my schooling, this film was made for just $10. You can see *Taking a Little to Feel Sorry for Myself* two days early on September 28th by becoming a $10 Patron!
 

 
 **Here's the simple idea:** For the price of a movie ticket through Patreon, you will get early access to each movie prior to their ultimate free release. *Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* is the first movie to be using this system, but expect future releases' early access period to be more dramatic. All money raised through Patreon will go solely to bringing the next project to life. If successful, this will result in a beautiful situation allowed by the internet, where audiences can directly support the filmmakers with no middlemen. And best yet, the movies will ultimately be released for free, never permanently locked behind a paywall. So there'll be an ever-growing library of films to make the judgement call if that investment is worth it for you.
 
 Read more about that here: [https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver](https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver)
 

 
 While I'm able to produce for dirt cheap, these projects take forever, don't expect more than 2 a year on average! Check my Patreon for updates on projects in the works.
 

 
 I think the future of filmmaking is one of online self distribution with a direct connection between audience and filmmaker and if no one else has the gonads to welcome in that future maybe I'll have to!

I am independently producing and directing a feature documentary, called YOUTH v GOV, about 21 brave youth who are leading this groundbreaking lawsuit against the US government over their constitutional rights to a healthy climate.
 

 
 **YOUTH v GOV is the story of America's youth taking on the world's most powerful government.**Â In 2015, 21 young plaintiffs, ages 8 to 19, filed suit against the U.S. government asserting a willful violation of their constitutional rights. YOUTH v GOV follows this legal battle as the government takes extraordinary measures to get the case dismissed.Â Legal experts call this case the most important lawsuit on the planet,"" but it's more than just a legal battle.
 
 **The heart of this film lies in the young plaintiffs' personal stories as they find their footing as leaders and come to know their power as citizens in our democracy.**Â YOUTH v GOV highlights and explores youth activism, government responsibility, our constitutional rights, and the importance of citizen democracy. It's about the hope and action that our youngest generation is bringing to the forefront as they realize the power in their experiences and voices. Their story will resonate with audiences of all ages with the unexpected result that we will all be learning from our youngest how to be active, engaged democratic citizens once again.

 Today is a work day for me so I will be responding throughout the day starting at 8amPST/11am EST. I will be replying through the day.
 
 **Edit** 1230EST I am slowly pecking away at responses throughout the day, between patients and work. Please be patient! I'll focus on the most upvoted for now but I will look for unique questions as well!
 
 **Edit** 1400EST 838 new messages in my inbox - it's unrealistic at my pace I'll respond to everything but I'm doing my best.
 
 **edit** 1530EST - I'm replying and now it's at 1125 new messages. Thank you all for your contributions and I am continuing to work at my plodding pace. I couldn't dedicate today to replies like I have done previously, so it's nowhere near fast enough to reply.
 
 **edit** 1800EST I have to formally say here, and sorry that those who don't get a reply, that I can't provide specific medical advice on reddit. I'll do my best but there are many people who are posting their personal stories. I've read them. I care. I hope help is available and I feel my other responses have addressed a lot of what my general advice would be. I will reply where I can but there is an overwhelming amount to get through. 
 
 **edit** 2030 EST I have to tap out now... I will try my best to get to questions I feel are left unanswered but I should probably turn off the faucet now. For those who have shared stories, thank you, and I'm sorry I couldn't get to everyone. Today was truly epic and eye opening to how much more I need to get more public messaging out there. 
 
 If there's one thing i want everyone here to know, it's the following phrase for the people in your life: ""hey just to let you know, if you ever need me, give me a call, I really care about you.""

 **About Yee Studios and the history of Duck Farm!**
 
 Duck farm! is Yee Studios first project. Originally started as a small project back in February 2018. I got the idea when I came across a simple mobile idle game called [Car Merger](https://itunes.apple.com/app/car-merger/id1321933151?mt=8) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDhkKxjWd1c) by TairaGames on youtube showing a pixel art duck game he made. It was originally meant to just be a Car Merger clone with ducks instead, but over the months it's changed and become the unique and quirky idle game it is now! I ran into a development issue back in March. I discovered that in Canada you need to be 19 to release an app. I just recently turned 19 so development has started up again!",3,9kb8e3

IAmA,Ever dreamed of hitting the eject button out of the rat race to go set up shop on some quiet beach in the tropics? That's exactly what we did. AMA.,"**Office Space** came out the year I graduated from university and started my first ""real"" job. Talk about serendipity :)
 
 At a time in my life when I most needed affirmation that it was OK to admit that cubicles and corporate ladders weren't for me, I got it. 
 
 There had to be a better way.
 
 And while it took well over a decade of trial  &  error to figure it out - my wife and I are pretty confident we've finally worked out our great escape.
 
 Almost 10 years ago now we were teaching English in Chile (we'd previously met while teaching in South Korea and also taught together in Vietnam) when it dawned on us that ESL forever wasn't going to be the right solution. Having worked for almost 7 years as a tour guide in Europe before we met, my wife suggested that we try to get into the tourism industry.
 
 No problem.
 
 Except how do we do that? Particularly when most jobs related to tourism are awfully low paid.
 
 # The only logical solution was to start our own business
 
 Not only would running our own business (theoretically) allow us to earn a decent living in tourism, it would also provide us with full control over our vacation time. We love to travel and one of our biggest fears when looking at alternatives beyond ESL was being able to find a job that would allow 2-3 months off per year. Yes, a lofty goal but our goal nevertheless.
 
 At any rate, after toying around with a bunch of different ideas, from a traveling English school that would essentially blend a European tour bus and English camp into one to a hostel or other types of guided tours, we were open to anything. But we kept coming back to the idea of potentially opening up our own beach hotel.
 
 It just seemed to implausible.
 
 # Back to Korea
 
 While we were working on the particulars we decided it was best to return to Korea where the money was better. We could start saving capital while we figure out what we wanted to do.
 
 Slowly but surely our plans came together.
 
 We decided on Mexico. And planned to build a very small boutique hotel where we would also provide 3 meals per day. Sort of like if a Bed  &  Breakfast and a beach resort had a baby. 
 
 Our concept was to provide a legitimate alternative to the giant soulless corporate resort. A place where perhaps less-adventurous travelers could both relax and have an experience that wasn't a Costco Vacation.
 
 After 3 years of saving like maniacs - we moved to Mexico and made it happen.
 
 # The old-fashioned way
 
 The only problem was that we'd never built a beach resort before. 
 
 And while we certainly had 'some' capital saved up for the project, it was a fraction of what any sane person would figure was reasonable for a project of this magnitude.
 
 So along with our life savings, we added a whole lot of elbow grease. I made [this album](https://imgur.com/gallery/bnREQ) 4 years ago for /r/DIY and while not exhaustive, it provides a pretty good idea of our construction process.
 
 In short, we figured it out as we went. Often using Google to teach us construction skills we needed on the fly.
 
 # Fast forward
 
 Long story short, after a bumpy beginning we're finally to a point where the business is relatively mature. Not exactly where we want to be numbers wise but good enough that it's no longer stressful to watch our inbox for reservations. 
 
 We've been given a [Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g153373-d4076432-Reviews-Gecko_Rock_Resort-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html) a couple times, which is from being consistently ranked in the top 3 of your category for the year...and we get a lot of return guests, which is the ultimate compliment for all the hard work we've put in. That out of everywhere there is to go in the world on vacation, people choose to come back again with us instead of trying something new.
 
 It's hard to believe that next month we'll be opening for our 5th full season at Gecko Rock.
 
 Ask me anything.

IAmA,"We are Dr. Victor Schwartz and Dr. Christine Moutier, the Chief Medical Officers at JED and AFSP. As you settle into a new school year and routine, it's important to check in on your friends about their mental health. Ask us anything about how to help a friend who might be struggling.","[Updated]: Thanks everyone for joining our AMA about mental health. If you're looking for more resources on signs to watch out for, starting the conversation or following up with a friend, please visit: www.SeizeTheAwkward.org. 
 
 As doctors who have spent our careers focused on mental health and fighting suicide, we know that talking about mental health can be awkward, but we also know how much it can help! Whether you're reconnecting after the summer apart or starting a new friendship, the start of the school year is an especially important time to check in with a friend about how they're doing. Just starting a conversation with a friend, no matter how awkward it may feel, can make a real difference in someone's life. 
 
 I'm Dr. Victor Schwartz and I have over 25 years of experience as a psychiatrist working in college mental health. I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine, and prior to becoming Chief Medical Officer at the Jed Foundation (JED), the nation's leading national nonprofit organization that exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for our nation's teens and young adults, I was the medical director of NYU's Counseling Service, and served as University Dean of Students at Yeshiva University.
 
 I'm Dr. Christine Moutier and after losing colleagues to suicide early in my medical career, I decided to dedicate my career to fighting this leading cause of death. As a practicing psychiatrist, professor of psychiatry, and as the Chief Medical Officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), the nation's largest suicide prevention organization, I am focused on helping people be more open about their mental health, seeking help when they need it, and identifying ways to optimize care for those living with mental health conditions. 
 
 Friends can usually tell when something is off with their friends, and they are often the first to recognize the early signs of mental health problems. They want to do something to help, but don't always know what to say or how to start the conversation. Seize the Awkward, a campaign developed by JED, AFSP and the Ad Council, aims to encourage young adults to create a safe space for their friends to talk about their mental health, and educate them on how to have those conversations and support a friend in need. Watch the campaign videos [here,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r47l4eUU1bc & list=PLdSSKSOSBh4l56j7S7HxdZPTmO5iqvKCe) or visit www.SeizeTheAwkward.org for more resources.

 The aim for the competition isÂ to address a problem facing the world using synthetic biology “ taking advantage of biological systems for useful purposes.
 
 This year our project aims to produce oxygen from a toxic compound called perchlorate using genetically engineered bacteria.
 
 Perchlorate is used in rocket fuel and can contaminate water and food, with potential harmful effects, especially on unborn children. It is also found abundantly in Martian dust and dirt (regolith).Â 
 
 We are working on a bioreactor that could use these bacteria to produce breathable oxygen and arable soil.

 So I beat Pokemon Yellow, Silver, Emerald, Y and Omega Ruby. Loved them all, and was looking forward to playing through Sun & Moon, but then some real life stuff happened, and I kinda forgot about them. Recently I heard that their enhanced versions came out and decided to finally grab one. 
 
 This time I decided to play Pokemon it in a new way. Instead of looking up every new pokemon beforehand and carefully planning my party, I just kinda discover everything on my own, and it's been pretty fun so far... 
 
 ...in those rare moments the game would actually LET me discover stuff on my own. I feel like every 2 minutes I'm being interrupted by a new cutscene, or a meaningless dialogue with your ""rival"", or a lengthy explanation of something, etc. Everything feels so dragged out, the simple animations of characters waving at each other take like 5 seconds where just 1 would be enough. I feel like I'm never allowed to be left alone to be on my own and this instantly kills all joy I find in this game. Initially this made me drop the game for a couple of months, and when I got back to it, I managed to finally get through the first isle, thinking that maybe it will be not so tedious after that. But so far it feels like it's nothing changed... 
 
 For the record, I have nothing against plot and cutscenes in video games. On the contrary, I tend to find games with them more enjoyable. But in this case, it just breaks the flow of the game in the most terrrible way... 
 
 So I wanted to ask, is this something that happens throughout the entire game? Even on isles 2, 3 and 4? Because if so, I really don't think I can keep playing through the game like this. Does anyone else feel this way or is this just my problem?",3,9eo9mg

pokemon,Share your thoughts and speculations about how Meltan is encountered in-game!,"So I had this crazy thought about how to implement Meltan in Pokemon LGP and LGE, without making people feel that it is lazy and out of nowhere.
 
 And it has something to do with that truck.
 
 Yes, that truck in Vermilion City.
 
 So the player first enters Vermilion City and sees that truck, but it is surrounded by different NPCs. Curious, you approached one of the NPC and they say,
 
 ""My Uncle works for Game Freak and has told me that there was something mysterious about this truck!""
 
 Another one says, ""My neighbor told me a Pokemon is hiding under this truck!""
 
 Another one says, ""I have never seen this truck driven by anyone, and it has been parked here for years without accumulating a single fleck of dust!""
 
 The NPCs are standing so coincidentally perfect that it is impossible to interact with the truck. What about interacting it from the water? Nope. There are two trainers each riding a Lapras also blocking the player from interacting with the truck.
 
 As there is nothing to do with the truck, and you cannot force anyone to leave, you continue on your journey.
 
 ...
 
 After beating the Elite Four, you are contacted by Professor Oak about that truck and you return to Vermilion City. There, Oak gives you a special machine detecting Pokemon and instructs you to bend under and investigate the truck. The game will then enter into a look-around mode (just like finding the Mimikyu Acerola's Trial in Pokemon SM / USUM), and you try to spot something unusual.
 
 You see a strange shiny nut lodged under the side of the truck, and using the machine Oak gave you, there is a reaction! A single eyeball appeared inside the nut and you feel the whole truck starting to turn into jelly, you quickly jump back out and then you witness the entire truck transforming into...
 
 Meltan!!
 
 Cue some cool music and the encounter starts immediately (Deoxys style in Pokemon ORAS), defeat it, and then catch it when its HP reaches 0.
 
 Oak mutters some lore/scientific stuff/congrats/""I knew something was dodgy about that truck"" stuff and then walks off.
 
 So, here's just my take on how to find Meltan in game. Obviously this is just a speculation thread and is not to be taken seriously.

 Recently, I have been rewatching the Pokemon television series with my wife while replaying the 1st and 2nd gen games to completion. We have had a very difficult past few months with a medical bankruptcy and new job, yet every evening when all was said and done, we had Pokemon and each other. We both love Pokemon, and it actually is part of what brought us together. Being able to literally take a time capsule back to your youth by booting up Pokemon is an indescribably cathartic feeling and now that life is good again, I wanted to say thanks.

Now for one of these, it has been used but it's the rotom heat form so I didn't really count it since it not the main form. 
 The first one would be fairy fighting. This is something that I really want to see even though it would be 2x weak to steel, poison, psychic, flying and fairy. I want this typing because it would be cool to have a cute fighting type and I feel like it would work.
 The other one (I have put way more thought in this one) is fire electric typing. Now I'm aware that this typing has been used by rotom's heat form. But I feel like I have a better idea for it. Being a fire electric type, it would be 4x weak to ground and 2x weak to water and rock. I want to make this Pokemon a pseudo legendary because neither fire nor electric has been used in a pseudo legendary before. Obviously give this Pokemon the ability levitate because the combining of fire and electricity would have to occur in the air and couldn't be reached by land.
 Yes I am aware of how this sounds almost exactly like rotom's heat form except for it being a pseudo legendary that would be part of a 3 part evolution line. But I feel it would be much better than a oven. Make it a special sweeper with high special attack and speed and balance the other stats out to reach to 600 base stat total of pseudo Legendaries.
 
 Anyone have a unique typing or want to make a new Pokemon that has a typing that is only used once and want to make it better?",4,9ft6kq

 Here's my list. 
 1. Pokemon Platinum
 2. HGSS
 3. Emerald
 4. Black 2 and White 2

 I'm playing a Generations Nuzlocke, where you do a Nuzlocke and then transfer eggs of the survivors forward and use them in the next game, and have just arrived at HeartGold. And man, it's just so good. The games just feel so gosh dang **polished**.
 
 I obviously love that the Pokemon follow you, but the menu on the touch screen is so convenient, the auto-run is so handy, and I just love how vibrant and colorful Johto is in these games. BW2 are still my favorite games I think, but I've really come around on HGSS just based on how incredibly well polished the games are.",4,9fg1cs

pokemon,Which Spin Off Disappointed You For Completely Subjective Reasons?,"Pokemon has put out a multitude of spin off titles, more so in the earlier generations. With so many interpretations of Pokemon out there, each one is bound to make someone blindly angry. Which spin off title do you dislike for personal, subjective reasons yet can respect that it is probably a good game in most people's eyes.
 
 Upon further thinking, I think I have two. First one being Baffle Revolution for the Wii. I can respect that, objectively, it is a fine game. It provides so many randomly generated battle formats and such that it truly feels like Battle Frontier meets Pokemon Stadium (and, controversial opinion, i think it, objectively out classes both Emerald's Frontier and the two Stadium titles once you remove nostalgia). However, I was livid that the next big 3D console spin off was NOT in style of Colosseum and XD. I adored those games and Colosseum even had gameplay modes that resembled Stadium 1 and 2. So it wasn't an insane idea to be mad at this game for not having ANY story mode at all. 
 
 A more recent game that has pissed me off is Detective Pikachu. This is more on principle. Pokemon spent years and years developing this title. They could have out sourced someone to make a new PMD. A new Ranger. A new Conquest. Or even a new idea. But no: in the generation where we (debateably) reached the most intricate story telling for Pokemon thus far, even going as far as to make the MULTIVERSE canon while on a console that can handle even a 3D Mario title...we get essentially a point and click adventure with gameplay a step above a dating simulator. I was livid that this time and energy didn't go into something with more gameplay and entertainment value.

 So maybe the only reason why some pokemon did not made the cut as a wild maybe due to the hardware wouldn't allow anymore pokemon to be obtainable in the wild?
 
 That clearly wouldn't be an issue with the nintendo switch.
 
 Plus gamefreak really do like pushing the local dex with after every game they make, so maybe we could have another ""everyone is here"" surprise, except is pokemon.",4,9j1ntv
pokemon,Most dissapointing team member you had in a playthrough?,"Here I go again with one of these ""your team"" posts.
 Plain and simple like the title, what was a Pokemon that just didn't live up to your expectations or was just less useful than you thought?
 
 For me it was Turtonator, he has an ok design and a great typing but the movepool was just lackluster and he rarely got kills. Also due to the low speed stat he was always being outsped and thus if he didn't nab a kill he got hit at least twice (this could lead to him getting killed at times).",3,9ex38r

pokemon,Would you buy a full Pokemon Quest game?,"With all Pokemon, more depth, a story and obviously without the restrictions of a free mobile game.
 
 I think I would. This game plays differently to any other Pokemon game I have played and I like that it's actually not that easy, requires some strategy and has this randomness factor - depending on the Pokemon you get through cooking your main team(s) would probably look entirely different every time you start a new game. Reminds me of Nuzlockes.
 
 I also like that Pokemon of the same species can be vastly different from each other and even non-evolved Pokemon can be the MVP of your team (my strongest Pokemon had been a Bellsprout for some time).",3,9iip22

pokemon,Let's Go Eevee rant,"My whole life I have dreamed of an Eevee version paired with Yellow, and I'm getting that wish.
 
 The issue? There are more Eevees now, and they aren't including any of the ones that appeared later.
 
 It's supposed to be EEVEE version. I want a whole team of different Eevees. I understand maybe leaving out the ones that came past gen 2, but I feel upset that Espeon, and Umbreon aren't even in the new games. They're just as classic as Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon. Gary's Eevee even became Umbreon in the anime.
 
 Now we have this weird hex nut legendary when I was hoping they'd promote a new Eevee. If this were Dragon Quest, a metal ditto wouldn't seem so out of ordinary, but this just seems.. bad for Pokemon.
 
 If Raichu can get Alolan Raichu, then I think Eevee should of got a new evolution for Let's Go Pikachu, and Eevee. It just doesn't make sense to not include unique Eevee features. I'm so livid. 
 
 Granted, the whole mysterious Pokemon go event was genius. For once we feel like the who's that Pokemon thing actually feels relevant again. It's been awhile since we ever felt motivated to go out and learn about a Pokemon like the anime does. I'm still not 100% happy though.",4,9ishpb
