I've been travelling solo on my motorcycle for the past 3 years. I've explored almost the totality of Australia and the Americas; heading now for the old continent. AmA !!,"Hey Reddit! 
My name is Paolo. I'm 37yo and 3 years ago i quit my IT job in Australia and started travelling solo on my motorcycle.
I haven't stop since.
I spent a year roughly, going all around Australia and then i shipped my motorcycle to South America and started riding up from there. 
I recently reached Alaska and came back to Vancouver, so now i'm planning my route towards Europe and across Asia to reach Australia again, to complete my round the world trip.
I post one picture a day. 
All my pictures are taken with my cellphone but I carry a drone as well.

I've also been sponsored by some brands that sell motorcycle gear and equipment.
I do NOT get paid to travel and i've been sustaining myself just with my savings, accumulated with few years of work.

Before I left for this trip, I always wondered how people that did these kind of things (travelling for long periods of time) were actually able to do it. 
So, here i am, hopefully answering some question and making myself useful in this sense for others that may have the same questions i had, before i started my journey.

AmA!

Riding with: KTM 1190 adventure  2014 model.

EDIT: OMG! you guys are amazing! Thanks for all the nice questions. I'll try to answer to all of you. Some of them are redundant so if i don't answer is because there's already something similar out there.

EDIT 2: I'm overwhelmed by all the interesting questions and nice words i ve received. Going to bed now. I ll come back tomorrow to answer some more! THANK YOU ALL!

EDIT 3: I'm still trying to answer all of the questions. I ll take a break now but continue on tonight. THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR ENQUIRIES! Over a 1000 ! Doing my best to reply to all of you. 

EDIT 4: OK!!!!  THAT'S IT FOR NOW! Thank you soooooo much for all the questions and the beautiful words of encouragement and support. It s truly remarkable to see how many people would want to travel and explore our fabulous planet.
Also thanks to all the haters that took time to stop and say hi and ask irrelevant or silly questions. You make the internet the most interesting place ever and you are confirming us, with your unnecessary behaviour, that we are doing the right thing.

Hopefully i ll meet some of you on the road and make sure you follow my instagram to see where I am at.
Drop me a line if you see me passing through. Happy to share few stories and a chat.

I save people a lot of TIME in their degree programs for Nursing, Business Administration, and Education. To check out my brand, you can search for: Doctor-My-Document of Boston

 I’m doing an AMA because I want to connect with awesome redditor-freelancers interested in getting involved with paper-writing service or Online Class Help. I have a lot of useful ideas to share with anyone trying to make a living as a writer-for-hire. 

1. **Nursing Research and Online Class Help:** Almost half of my clients are nursing students who need help with nursing papers in APA style. I hire great writers to help with NURSING - LPN degree through doctoral degrees. We write research proposals for Quality Improvement, Action Research, Community Health Nursing Initiatives, Culturally Sensitive Educational Interventions, and a whole lot more. We always cite high-quality sources, like articles in professional medical and nursing journals. The writers who work with me to offer nursing paper help have subscriptions to databases full of the most recent articles in the publication that need to be cited in any postgraduate or professional paper. Nursing paper writing service is in higher demand than any other type of paper writing service I offer.
2. **Masters of Education:** You can be the most inspired teacher in the world, and that still doesn’t make it any easier to get through grad school. The worst part is using APA style citations and reference lists, because there is literally a whole book of rules to follow. It seems absurd that every degree candidate has to follow a whole book full of rules about how to write with APA style. And then after that, degree candidates have to learn research methodology. It’s a HUGE amount of information, trying to compare all the various quantitative and qualitative methods, and figure out how they can contribute to their professional fields. If you’re a great writer and you don’t mind using APA style, I need your help with research and writing for my clients who are completing their degrees in Education. Many are at the undergraduate level, but most of them are completing postgraduate research.
3. **Masters of Business Administration:** Entrepreneurship, Accounting, Human Resource Management, Strategic Planning, Technology – a lot of people are completing Business Administration degrees because it’s required by their jobs, and they need help from talented writers. It’s company policy, so they are trying to do online classes while they also work 60+ hours at their competitive jobs.

Those are the areas where I do the most work: nursing research (i.e. for nursing students, LPN-DNP), Business Administration (MBA), and Masters of Education.  

**How much to charge?**

I ask clients to pay $119 per 1000 words for undergraduate level writing and $129 per 1,000 words for graduate level.  With double-spaced APA style, 1,000 words = about 3-4 pages.  

* For a short paper, I'll ask clients to pay $69 for 550 words.  
* A five-page paper costs $179.
* If someone needs a 20+ page dissertation proposal, s/he can pay $129/week for six weeks. 
* Clients who need Online Class Help can pay a flat weekly rate.  

People in any of the degree programs I mention above need papers written in APA style (6th edition) with citations/references to professional journal articles (APA citations/references). I help with article critiques, systematic reviews, research proposals, PICO(T) papers for nurses, lesson plans for teachers, SWOT analysis for business, and almost anything else you can think of.

**It’s hard to win a rat race when you have to keep stopping to do homework.** College is great for kids who still live at home, but for busy professionals it’s just a lot of work. College paper writing service &amp; Online Class Help are really controversial, because so many people think it’s not ethical to get help writing a paper.

For those of us who want to write for a living, it’s worthwhile to at least consider the idea to work for someone who needs help writing a paper. Some people say degree candidates should all learn APA and research methodology without any help. Many people on reddit probably did exactly that. Your school might have a policy where you can only get help from your adviser. Secretly, you might have gotten some help from a spouse or friend, too. Well, getting that kind of help is the basis for a whole industry now. 

**It’s totally understandable when people say degree candidates should do all their work themselves.** But it’s just more complicated than that, with for-profit colleges, language barriers, exploitative recruiting, and… well, a degree is an expensive and complicated commodity. A common for a person to need help writing a paper.

For those of you who don’t approve of Academic Writing work, please take it easy on me. Language barriers, time constraints, and other factors really do create situations where you would say, “YES, I see why that person would hire a writer for help with a class.” The Online Class Help industry is not great, but it’s not the worst thing in the world either. We are not the ones who undermined American higher education. It has already been undermined by the profit motive before we got here.  

[PROOF: Please scroll down slightly and find the image with me holding a paper with today’s date &amp; my username.](http://doctormydocument.com/) (Look for the kitten).

Other stuff: 

Most of my clients are completing one of the following types of degrees:

Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)

Master of Education (M.Ed.)

Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (BBA)

Masters of Business Administration (MBA)

Master of Science in Nursing (MSN)

Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)

A lot of them go on to get their PhD degrees, so they hire me for help writing their dissertations. 

For anyone interested in writing APA papers for Business, Education, &amp; Nursing classes: These papers require a ton of research to find out all the trending concepts, and write about them for your class. After ten years in these new industries -- “Online Class Help” and “Academic Writing” – I developed a specialization in those three areas I mentioned – people who in Nursing School, people completing their MBA degrees (Business Administration), &amp; or people completing their Masters of Education. From degree candidates studying who need nursing paper help, papers for their MBA/Business Administration, or a research proposal for their Masters of Education, there is a lot of demand for professional paper-writers.",,9gclqa,,0,,false,1540131859,false,self,t5_2qzb6,,specialized,,false,true,,/r/IAmA/comments/9gclqa/i_am_a_college_paperwriter_from_boston_with_10/,,,false,Specialized Profession,

AMA!,"I'm a documentary filmmaker and have been following the Juliana et al. vs. The United States of America et al. landmark lawsuit for the past 2.5 years. I am independently producing and directing a feature documentary, called YOUTH v GOV, about 21 brave youth who are leading this groundbreaking lawsuit against the US government over their constitutional rights to a healthy climate.

&amp;#x200B;

**YOUTH v GOV is the story of America’s youth taking on the world’s most powerful government.** In 2015, 21 young plaintiffs, ages 8 to 19, filed suit against the U.S. government asserting a willful violation of their constitutional rights. YOUTH v GOV follows this legal battle as the government takes extraordinary measures to get the case dismissed. Legal experts call this case the “most important lawsuit on the planet,"" but it's more than just a legal battle.

**The heart of this film lies in the young plaintiffs’ personal stories as they find their footing as leaders and come to know their power as citizens in our democracy.** YOUTH v GOV highlights and explores youth activism, government responsibility, our constitutional rights, and the importance of citizen democracy. It’s about the hope and action that our youngest generation is bringing to the forefront as they realize the power in their experiences and voices. Their story will resonate with audiences of all ages with the unexpected result that we will all be learning from our youngest how to be active, engaged democratic citizens once again.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently running a [Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.youthvgovthefilm.com/joinus) to raise production funds for this film and would love for you to check out the project and learn more about the story and this historic lawsuit.

I was the Executive Producer for the Pornhub Awards Show that took place on Thursday night, which featured Kanye West as Creative Director!

I am also the CEO and owner of Utherverse Digital and HoloFilm Productions; two world leading VR companies in the CG VR space and filmed/streamed VR space respectively.

I hold more than 50 patents on technology innovations in numerous areas, including many that have allowed Virtual Reality tech to become realized.

My company was primarily responsible for the Kanye West Pornhub Awards Show, and we provided all the virtual reality components including RedLightCenter.com as the platform for attending the show in a virtual world with no headset required, and Oasis.game for attending the show using VR headsets.

I have also produced and directed more than 200 VR movies and scenes for HoloGirlsVR (adult) and HoloFilm Productions (everything non-adult).

I was the Executive Producer of The Pornhub Games reality show hosted by Asa Akira.

I figured it would be a good time for an updated AMA, especially since there’s many people who couldn’t ask their questions years ago!    

I posted [this](https://i.imgur.com/yKq8Pee.jpg) picture recently as an updated photo comparison with no makeup, to give the best example of how subtle changes in the face can make all of the difference in how you’re perceived! But [here](https://i.imgur.com/dQx6P5j.jpg) is a comparison with day to day makeup.

If the mods require more proof just let me know, but you can see through my extensive post history and my AMA in my submission history that I am who I say I am. So ask away! What is it that you want to know about trans people that you might have been afraid to ask otherwise? Or just questions you have in general!    

Edit: and a [body](https://imgur.com/a/Mf30dLu) comparison.         

Edit 2: I’m answering questions as fast as I can but every time I answer one, 3 more pop up! Be patient as I’m trying to get to as many people as I can, and also see if I answered your question already!

KSP made its first public release back in 2011, and made it out of Early Access in 2015. In 2016 I left Squad to pursue new projects, and created [Floating Origin Studios](https://floatingoriginstudios.com), my own dev shop. 

I am now working on a new game, which is just about ready for its first release into Early Access. Like KSP, it is also based on a childhood hobby of mine, Model Aviation. It is called [BALSA Model Flight Simulator](https://balsamodelsim.com).  
  
(now that I think about it, my parents were pretty chill about entrusting me with power tools...) 

I'm not here to plug though, I'm here to answer your questions about what was, what is and what will be, so ask away!

I am a candidate for the Missouri State House of Representatives. I did an AMA back in March, and I'm here again to answer your questions about the campaign trail! AMA!","Hi, I'm [James Cordrey](https://www.jamescordrey.com), Democratic candidate for 109th State Representative in the great state of Missouri. Back in March, I spent [several hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/82yyiw/hey_im_james_cordrey_the_guy_that_brought_you/) answering questions about politics in Missouri. But, a lot has changed since then: We have a new governor, our primary election has come and gone, and Proposition A (Right to Work) failed by a healthy margin.

So I'm here to to answer your questions. The experience last time was great, and I got a lot of good feedback from a lot of people. I probably won't have as much time to answer questions tonight as I did back in March, but we'll give it a go.

A little bit about me: I'm a 32 year old software developer. I work for a company that helps banks process loans and prevent fraud. Before that, I worked for a document management software company, and before that I developed software for Hospitals. I grew up in a couple of different places in Missouri, but mostly on my Grandfather's farm. If you want to know more about my past, feel free to ask, or read the last AMA.

You can learn more about this campaign on my [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ElectJamesCordrey/), or my [Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/jamescordrey), or my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/jamesccordrey/). The candidates in Franklin County were on stage together at a forum hosted by East Central Community College, and the audio was posted online by [St. Louis Public Radio's Jason Rosenbaum](http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/listen-east-central-college-s-franklin-county-candidate-forum). (The 109th district portion starts at the 1 hour and 27 minute mark.) I also had an [interview on KTUI](https://www.facebook.com/KTUI1560/videos/351199948757225/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAPa0I5II7ZaxeyizpBVz_7E5TEZsrVVYgmQSvzArzq3ycF-nj4v5dpTJH_kmfJb6BMl72qoFzWRUEAmG50V_olmrlxKaR7ehEumonuPl0boHiXnYsiDiuepOKzW_7xC_tO-nB0NXahHHBCUGraNtWnLmHrG8CP6rW1LxQEB5GvGxSLFPv2&amp;__tn__=-R), which is a radio station based in Sullivan, MO., where I talked about the plans I want to work on if I'm lucky enough to be elected.

I have an opponent, now. His name is John Simmons. As the [Missourian said](http://www.emissourian.com/local_news/county/candidates-spar-at-east-central-college-forum/article_d427db46-c014-11e8-8a86-b723900e3295.html), we don't have a lot of common ground. But that's okay. I believe in talking with people you disagree with, and having public debate. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we're going to have any public debates in the 109th district.

That's why I wanted to have another AMA. I want people to ask questions that they want answers to, so they can make good choices when comparing candidates.

And, of course, if you're a US Citizen, and you want to donate to my campaign, you can do that [here](https://www.jamescordrey.com/donate).

**About Yee Studios and the history of Duck Farm!**

Duck farm! is Yee Studios first project. Originally started as a small project back in February 2018. I got the idea when I came across a simple mobile idle game called [Car Merger](https://itunes.apple.com/app/car-merger/id1321933151?mt=8) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDhkKxjWd1c) by TairaGames on youtube showing a pixel art duck game he made. It was originally meant to just be a Car Merger clone with ducks instead, but over the months it's changed and become the unique and quirky idle game it is now! I ran into a development issue back in March. I discovered that in Canada you need to be 19 to release an app. I just recently turned 19 so development has started up again!

At the time we wrote this, we didn't have official confirmation of the much-rumored trio of new iPhones nor the potential Apple Watch Series 4. But as our AMA kicks off, we're ready to share everything we learned from our hands-on impressions with new hardware, new software and whatever other surprises emerged.

We've both been covering Apple for years, from the business side to the hardware side, so feel free to ask whatever questions you have about their reveals, the new iPhones, what it all means following the iPhone X and increased competition from Samsung and Google or just what it's like to be in Steve Jobs Theater. We'll be around for a couple of hours starting at 9 am PT, so ask away.

Ask Us Anythine!","Tommy: I started climbing soon after I  learned to walk. Growing up with a mountain guide father, my talent and passion led me as a teenager to the top of climbing competitions and cutting-edge outdoor routes. In 2000, on a climbing expedition in Kyrgyzstan, my partners and I were captured and held hostage by armed rebels. Miraculously, after six days of captivity, our group managed to free ourselves. Upon returning to the United States and trying to piece together my life, I severed my index finger in a home remodeling accident. Managing to overcome the obstacles life was throwing at me, I came back stronger. My free climbing accomplishments in Yosemite National Park remain unmatched and made my one of the best rock climbers in the world, a perfect contender to be the first person to free climb The Dawn Wall.
 
Kevin: Like most kids, I grew up climbing ladders, trees and fences, until a visit to my local climbing gym changed my life forever. I steadily improved my climbing and started winning youth national championships. Once I discovered bouldering, I quickly made a name for myself as one of the sport’s best. At my home stomping grounds in the California’s Buttermilks, I made the first ascent of the terrifying Ambrosia, a 15-meter high boulder from which a fall near the top would be catastrophic. While searching to expand into other climbing disciplines, I learned about Tommy Caldwell’s initial forays on the Dawn Wall. Under the mentorship of Tommy, I proved a quick study as I transformed myself into a big wall climber capable of the completing the most continuously difficult route in the world.

My primary research interest is suicidology. I have published articles on the utilization of emergency departments for psychiatric services, the use of psychotropic medications, and authored and edited textbooks on Emergency Psychiatry and Psychopharmacology.



Today is World Suicide Prevention Day – where a (hopefully appropriate) spotlight on suicide prevention raises awareness to the tremendous amount of resources and support that exist out there in the world for people who are struggling with suicidal thinking.

So please, Ask Me Anything about the science of suicide, suicide prevention, suicide prevention training, the media’s reporting of suicide, risk documentation, or other topics you can think of!


WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide. Please be aware that the topics inside this AMA could be triggering or overwhelming for some. If you find yourself needing to reach out, please be aware of local and national crisis lines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines has a helpful list), find someone to talk to, or seek help at your local emergency health facility. Help is available and people with suicidal thinking receiving help experience significant relief and positive outcomes!

Today is a work day for me so I will be responding throughout the day starting at 8amPST/11am EST. I will be replying through the day.

**Edit** 1230EST I am slowly pecking away at responses throughout the day, between patients and work.  Please be patient!  I'll focus on the most upvoted for now but I will look for unique questions as well!

**Edit** 1400EST 838 new messages in my inbox - it's unrealistic at my pace I'll respond to everything but I'm doing my best.

**edit** 1530EST - I'm replying and now it's at 1125 new messages.  Thank you all for your contributions and I am continuing to work at my plodding pace.  I couldn't dedicate today to replies like I have done previously, so it's nowhere near fast enough to reply.

**edit** 1800EST I have to formally say here, and sorry that those who don't get a reply,  that I can't provide specific medical advice on reddit.  I'll do my best but there are many people who are posting their personal stories.  I've read them. I care.  I hope help is available and I feel my other responses have addressed a lot of what my general advice would be.  I will reply where I can but there is an overwhelming amount to get through. 

**edit** 2030 EST I have to tap out now... I will try my best to get to questions I feel are left unanswered but I should probably turn off the faucet now.  For those who have shared stories, thank you, and I'm sorry I couldn't get to everyone.  Today was truly epic and eye opening to how much more I need to get more public messaging out there.  

If there's one thing i want everyone here to know, it's the following phrase for the people in your life:  ""hey just to let you know, if you ever need me, give me a call, I really care about you.""

**edit 0430am: thank you all! I put my best effort in and thank you to amazing redditors who also stepped up.  Good night reddit!**",,9ens3f,,2,,false,1540103331,false,self,t5_2qzb6,,health,,false,true,,/r/IAmA/comments/9ens3f/today_is_world_suicide_prevention_day_i_am_a/,,,false,Health,

I have been a sales manager/tech support for exactly a year now, and would love to answer any questions you might have regarding the LED industry, how these giant screens work, or anything else you might be interested in.  

I have noticed a big insurgence in LED related posts recently, from the jumbotron at a soccer stadium getting used for FIFA, or those little spinning LED fans type things.

In my youth, I was a pacifist who evaded serving in the French military. But decades later while I was working in Britain, I was taken aback to see that the rebellious behavior leading to my deferral remained in a my French personnel file. I needed it to be updated before I could return home to France to work after ten years and the only way to clear my dossier was to be re-evaluated and join the French military. In a surreal series of events, I found the French, British, and Israeli Secret Services were all interested in me. In the end, I decided to serve in the medical corps of the French army as a way to settle my debts with the military. So, In my mid-fifties, I became a liaison emergency doctor in war-torn Afghanistan.

My memoir offers a unique perspective on the conflict in Afghanistan, how war is waged and about the medical challenges presented by the expansion of terrorism into Europe and the United States.

American author Jessica Levine translated my memoir into English from the French version will also be joining the conversation.

Almost 2 years ago I quit my comfy web dev job so I could live out of my van and shoot astro-landscape photos full time. This last July, thanks in large part to Reddit, I was able to hang one of my pieces at the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Ops Center. AMA!","Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2017 I took the plunge and quit my comfy, corporate front-end web-dev job to attempt to live out my dream of shooting landscape / astro-landscape photos and making &amp; selling prints full time. I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) ""following"" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn't be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.

&amp;#x200B;

Proof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I've had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my ""[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)"" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously ""[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)"" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.

&amp;#x200B;

As an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!

&amp;#x200B;

Using all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying.  Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I  [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it's a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing &amp; selling art, or whatever's on your mind. I'll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn't be here without you!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Hey guys and gals, this has been a boat load of fun but I've got to get back to work for a bit. Please feel free to keep firing the questions and I'll answer as many as I can later this evening. Thanks again Reddit, I love you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2 - 9/6/2018: Just one more edit. I want to say thank you so much for the Reddit Gold to the two of you who sent it my way! I was up late last night trying to reply to as many comments as possible, and I'll get through even more of them today, and thank you to all the commentors as well. If I don't reply to your specific question by the end of the day today it probably means that it was answered multiple times elsewhere in the thread, so poke around a bit, or feel free to shoot me a pm once my inbox cools off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I've mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron's line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there's another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to ""stack"" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, when you're first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site!  Google the ""Rule of 500"" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they'll still be cool and it's great practice!

&amp;#x200B;

If you're just getting into astro landscape photography, it's much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I'll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)

&amp;#x200B;

A solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you'll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!",,9d8hsu,,2,,false,1540079414,false,self,t5_2qzb6,,specialized,,false,true,,/r/IAmA/comments/9d8hsu/im_phil_mosby_almost_2_years_ago_i_quit_my_comfy/,,,false,Specialized Profession,

Hey, Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

We are Holly Jones &amp; Ola Denslaw, Tech Recruiters in the JavaScript contract space at [Venturi](https://www.venturi-group.com/). Ask us Anything! We are based in Manchester, UK and will be answering questions from 11am GMT.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this AMA because as tech recruiters, we are often asked by our network if we can help with CV reviews/edits, interview tips, the pro's of contracting, tech market intel and hopefully put to rest any negative connotations that may be associated with the recruitment industry.  We’ve put aside 4 hours today to have a Q&amp;A and answer all of your questions!

&amp;#x200B;

About us:

Holly – I have worked in the JavaScript recruitment space for 3 years, and now recruit contract developers in Manchester. I enjoy being involved and contributing to the tech community in Manchester and have recently launched Venturi Code Camp where myself and the team are learning to code through FreeCodeCamp and have begun the foundations of our own webpage.

&amp;#x200B;

Ola - Originally from Poland, I came to the UK at the age of 17 to study Criminology at University in Liverpool. I was always fascinated by technology which is how I got drawn towards recruitment particularly in the tech space, I now specialise in recruiting within Development&amp; Design space in London with a primary focus on the JavaScript market.  What I love about the contract market is how diverse it actually is and that I get to speak to so, so many interesting people every day!

The column I wrote about my son’s death from an overdose (“[The opioid crisis hits home – mine](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2018/09/05/lost-my-son-opioid-crisis-and-nothing-can-bring-him-back-column/1137093002/)”) triggered an outpouring of comments from readers who are dealing with this awful affliction.

I know the emotional and financial toll addiction can take on families, but I’m not qualified to dispense medical advice. So Dr. Fishman is joining me for this AMA. Dr. Fishman is a psychiatrist and a faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He is the medical director of Maryland Treatment Centers and a national expert on adolescent addiction treatment and program development.

The Machine has been described as ""the most powerful fraternity in America"" and its tentacles reach to the State House, Washington and beyond. Ask us anything!","EDIT: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today! 

Hello! We're journalists Amy Yurkanin and John Archibald — we co-hosted an investigative podcast for Reckon by [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) called Greek Gods - on [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/alcom/reckon-radio) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reckon-radio/id1420215603?mt=2).

The podcast tells the story of a powerful secret society at the University of Alabama called 'The Machine,' which has controlled campus politics for more than a century and whose power extends to the State House, Washington, and beyond.

The Machine — known to members as Theta Nu Epsilon — serves as a training ground for Alabama politicians, schooling them in the political dark arts. It has spawned numerous governors, senators, and others. Even those who have opposed The Machine, including MSNBC 'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough and current Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, go on to political careers.

In the podcast, we delve into the organization's methods — including threats of violence, wire-tapping, boycotts, voter coercion, and more — and speak to those who've reported on the Machine and the people whose lives were affected by it.

Ask us anything!

**Personal bios:**

**John**

I’m John Archibald, a columnist for the Alabama Media Group, which includes the Birmingham News, the Huntsville Times, the Mobile Press-Register, [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) and the social phenom [Reckon](https://www.facebook.com/ReckonAL/).

[You can read my stories here.](http://connect.al.com/staff/jaarchib/posts.html)

 I’ve covered everything from crime and punishment to Birmingham City Hall, which is not always the same thing. I grew up in Alabama, went to the University of Alabama and found my life and my wife at the student newspaper there. I have three grown children who left me with their three dogs.

**Amy:**

I’m Amy Yurkanin, co-host and producer of Greek Gods. I live in Birmingham, Ala. with my husband, two kids, cat and lizard. We moved to Alabama from Las Vegas, where I wrote for an alt-weekly and also produced a talk show for the local NPR affiliate.

[You can find my stories here](http://connect.al.com/user/AmyYurk/posts.html).

After I recovered from the culture shock of moving from Sin City to the Bible Belt, I began to become interested in the Machine – the secret society that shaped the careers of my colleagues, John Archibald and John Hammontree. Greek Gods was my first foray into podcasting, but hopefully not my last.

The aim for the competition is to address a problem facing the world using synthetic biology – taking advantage of biological systems for useful purposes.

This year our project aims to produce oxygen from a toxic compound called perchlorate using genetically engineered bacteria.

Perchlorate is used in rocket fuel and can contaminate water and food, with potential harmful effects, especially on unborn children. It is also found abundantly in Martian dust and dirt (regolith). 

We are working on a bioreactor that could use these bacteria to produce breathable oxygen and arable soil.

We’ll be travelling to Boston, USA for the competition Jamboree.

We'll be answering questions on **Thursday and Friday (27th-28th Sept)**. ASK US ANYTHING!!!

This is the 4th year in a row my business has done over $1 million in revenue. AMA!,"I just enjoyed the 5-year anniversary of quitting my accounting job to sell stuff online, and I’m here to celebrate, answer your questions, and maybe even inspire a few of you to try something that you’ve had the itch to test out!

A little over 5 years ago now, I decided to make a change and pursue selling online full-time. I was working a job I didn’t love, and constantly found myself daydreaming about starting my own business.

I decided that I wanted to give it a real shot and started to prepare to exit the job.

At the time I quit my job I was able to get to the level of making about $1,000 per month dedicating about 10 hours per week to selling online.

I was confident that if I could dedicate full time hours to the project I could get to at least $4,000 per month working 40 hours per week.

It was still a bit of a risk, but a calculated one. It’s turned out that leaving that job was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

Over the past 5 years, I’ve built a great team of 10, expanded selling platforms, and learned a lot along the way. Today we sell products on Amazon, eBay, Jet.com, and our own websites. In 2018, we’re on track to break $5 Million in sales.

I have three businesses now - the one I originally quit my job for, a Shopify-based store that I bought and recently turned profitable, and [a blog](https://onlinesellingexperiment.com/) where I aim to help others build their own online retail businesses by sharing my experiences.

For all the reasons listed above, quitting my job to pursue my own business turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. It has given me more money, more time, and has allowed me to help other people in meaningful ways.

Ask me anything about selling online, quitting my job, running your own business, or anything else!

[Here's](https://goo.gl/Bv3Nfp) some proof, it's all in Korean but that's kind of unavoidable. Chances are that won't play outside of Korea, so [here's](https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=ur60K_1537841889) a recording of a recording.

I'm not alone, though! There are others from Australia, Vietnam, and we’re eagerly expecting another Filipina storyteller to join us in a few hours. We’ve been here for three weeks now, and the program runs for the full month of September. Aren't we [stylish](https://i.imgur.com/sXVD3Vf.jpg)?

The region Sachon is based in is called Gyeongsangbuk-do. Despite having some of the country’s more populated cities, people have been leaving the area for several years, and there’s real concern that some villages are going to just vanish off the map entirely.

Several local schools in Sachon have closed and been reopened as community centers, there are currently 12 students in the whole village, down from a high of 1,000. The reasons for this are the same reasons for population crashes in other industrialized Asian countries, the cost of educating a child in such a competitive environment have skyrocketed beyond the reach of most families, so people are putting off marriage and child-rearing for economic concerns.

One of the hopes for attracting international storytellers is to have them work a few hours each week educating area students, which should attract young parents to the village. The average age of the village is getting very near 50, without an influx of new blood there’s the very real possibility that Sachon will become a literal ghost town.

The regional government has actually been extremely active in preventing this, in years past they have helped construct two museums celebrating the history of the area, both as an agricultural powerhouse and as a hotbed of resistance against the Japanese occupation during the Imjin war. The house I’m staying in is actually immediately adjacent to a beautiful museum celebrating the “Uiseong Uibeong,” the “Uiseong Righteous Militia” which was comprised largely of Confucian scholars.

There are a LOT of Confucian schools in the area, and they’re some of the most breathtakingly beautiful architecture I’ve ever seen. It’s beyond gorgeous, like stepping onto the set of a historical drama. When it rains I keep expecting to see women in silk dresses gazing wistfully out across the horizon, but that’s just because I’m a sucker for wistful gazes.

If you happen to be a storyteller, the hope is to run 4-5 month-long residencies each year, with different themes. If that sounds like something you'd want to take part in, [follow us online](https://www.facebook.com/KStorytellingWorldTourProject/) for details on how to apply!

Also, we're going to be livestreaming a show on the 28th featuring some of our stories, and a performance by a traditional Korean musician. Feel free to [ask us questions](https://www.facebook.com/events/2153242884718121/) about the program or Korea in general!Last but not least, enjoy this [cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/LWa2Pcf.jpg).

I’m Michaela Bethune, Head of Campaigns at [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/us), the largest tech not-for-profit exclusively dedicated to young people   social change and civic action. I work everyday to ensure that young people, regardless of their party affiliation or ideology, make their voices heard in our political system by registering and voting.

In doing this work, I’ve had to learn the ins and outs of each state’s laws and make sure that our online voter registration portals, our members who run on-the-ground voter registration drives, and our messaging strategy are completely compliant with the complexities of voter registration rules and regulations as a not-for-profit, 501c3. 

Today is National Voter Registration Day! Since 2012, every year on the fourth Tuesday of September, hundreds of thousands of first-time voters register to vote on this day. It’s an amazing celebration of our democracy -- a time for all Americans to come together and get ready to vote. 

Curious about your state’s voter registration laws and how you can get registered? Or about the first voter registration laws? Or which state asked the question, “How many bubbles are in a bar of soap” for a literacy test to register to vote? Ask Me Anything about the world of voter registration, voter suppression, rights at the polls, or any other topic you think of! 

While you’re waiting for an answer, take 2 minutes and make sure you’re registered to vote and that your address is up to date by heading to [vote.dosomething.org](http://vote.dosomething.org/)

It’s great to be here with you today!

My name is Frank Blake -- I was the chairman and CEO of Home Depot for seven years. Now I tell inspiring stories about people who do amazing things for others on the [Crazy Good Turns podcast](https://crazygoodturns.org/).

One of the powerful lessons I learned at Home Depot was you get what you celebrate.  When you celebrate people who do something right, the results are usually more good work by that person and others.  The Crazy Good Turns podcast is bringing that idea to the world at a larger scale.  If we celebrate those who do good deeds, will we see more of them? If you hear a story about an inspiring person doing something amazing for somebody else, will you try to be a little better too? We invite you to join us on the journey and see.

Before we get started, here are a couple of my favorite podcast episodes:

[Team Rubicon](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/team-rubicon/)

We’ve heard too many times the stories of military veterans struggling to find a place in the civilian world.  Jake Wood of Team Rubicon unites the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams.

[The Gift](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/the-gift/)

In this episode we did something a little different, you hear five stories of incredible gifts or acts of kindness.  One of the five stories that stood out for me was the story of Janis Martinez, who caught fire at the age of two and was saved by a trucker who was willing to donate his skin for a skin graph.

I'm grateful for all the grassroots support for our campaign. It's a real David vs. Goliath campaign again. Wasserman Schultz is swimming in corporate donations, while we're relying on small online donations. Please consider donating at [https://timcanova.com/](https://timcanova.com/)

We need help with phone banking, door-to-door canvassing in the district, waving banners on bridges (#CanovaBridges), and spreading the word far and wide that we're in this to win it!

I am a law professor and political activist. Two years ago, I ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then the chair of the Democratic National Committee, in the August 30, 2016 Democratic primary that's still mired in controversy since the Broward County Supervisor of Elections illegally destroyed all the ballots cast in the primary. I was motivated to run against Wasserman Schultz because of her fundraising and voting records, and particularly her close ties with big Wall Street banks, private insurers, Big Pharma, predatory payday lenders, private prison companies, the fossil fuels industry, and many other big corporate interests that were lobbying for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In this rematch, it's exciting to run as an independent in a district that's less than 25% registered Republicans. I have pledged to take no PAC money, no corporate donations, no SuperPACs. My campaign is entirely funded by small donations, mostly online at:  [https://timcanova.com/](https://timcanova.com/) We have a great grassroots campaign, with lots of volunteer energy here in the district and around the country!

Ask Us Anything!,"Thanks for joining us for today's Reddit AMA on technosignatures! We're signing off, but you can learn more about our search at https://go.nasa.gov/2Dzgz2J 


Is there life out there, beyond the edge of our solar system? Are we alone? People from all walks of life have pondered those questions. For decades, NASA has lead the charge in finding out. Astrobiologists—scientists who study how life could live on other planets—search for clues in acidic lakes, deep under ice, or at searing hot hydrothermal vents in the ocean. They also think about what signs of life could look like on other worlds, including planets in our own solar system and exoplanets, which are planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. These signs are called “biosignatures,” and include things like certain types of molecules or traces left in a rock.
 
At the same time, other scientists have pioneered a different kind of search for life. These scientists look for signs of intelligent life who might be trying to reach out to others in the galaxy with radio or laser transmissions. These signs are called “technosignatures.” Other types of technosignatures include evidence of pollutants in an exoplanet atmosphere or signs of an extraterrestrial structure around an exoplanet or star.
 
We’re a group of scientists who study astrobiology, exoplanets (including potentially habitable ones!) and potential technosignatures, and we’re here to answer your questions about this exciting field! We’ll be online starting at 1:00 p.m. EDT and we will sign our answers with our names or initials.

As the founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, I have been working on developing technology, content, and live events with the mission of putting intelligent, tech-savvy, entrepreneurial women and girls at the center of pop culture and media. I also host a weekly business talk radio show called Dot Complicated on SiriusXM and have two TV shows on air: DOT on NBC Universal Kids (winner of Kidscreen's Best New Preschool Series) and American Dreams on HSN. I recently published my fourth book, *Pick Three* (May 2018) which challenges the fallacy of a well-balanced life.

I currently travel the world speaking about technology, entrepreneurship, my time as an early employee at Facebook, and how to unplug. Recently, I have been a proponent of blockchain technology and its potential to bring security and collaboration to communities across the world. I currently hold advisory positions at two blockchain companies: Huobi Chain ([huobi.com](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/)) and Pledgecamp ([pledgecamp.com](https://pledgecamp.com)).

When I'm doing my best to unplug you can find me at the theater--as a Tony awards voter, investor in the award-winning Dear Evan Hansen, and board member of the American Theatre Wing and Lincoln Center--or at home with my husband and two young sons.

**I'm a nerd,** so I've dug deep into the scoring models to figure out how to get the most points and create the most leverage.

My family lost our farm that had been in our family for 100 years in the 2008 crash and I've rebuilt my life and my credit and now I help other people do the same. Trial by fire. That story on the [DailyWorth](https://www.dailyworth.com/posts/4380-helping-my-dad-put-me-in-debt).

After that experience I've made it my life's work to leverage business credit so that people don't have to go through what we went through.

I have a new program coming out about building credit in your business name, without your personal guarantee.

I've done my fair share of raising money for a business, so feel free to ask about SBA loans, friends and family rounds, angel investing, VC, private or hard money, structured finance, etc. I also have a deep love of slow money strategies.

I've got a free video course over on [my website](https://wealthgenerationcollective.com/) that will give you custom advice about what to get better personal credit. None of that generic pay your bills on time. Yes, you should pay your bills on time, but that will only give you a 10-20 point jump.  I go over some of the counterintuitive things, like when you should apply for more credit, even right before you get a mortgage.

I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice. That also means I can tell you things that lawyers sometimes won't. I'm US based, but Canada has similar systems.

Since women earned the right to vote a little under one hundred years ago, our progress hasn't been the Olympic sprint toward gender equality first wave feminists hoped for, but more of a slow, elderly mall walk (with frequent stops to Cinnabon) over the four hundred million hurdles we still face. Some of these obstacles are obvious-unequal pay, under-representation in government, reproductive restrictions, lack of floor-length mirrors in hotel rooms. But a lot of them are harder to identify. They're the white noise of oppression that we've accepted as lady business as usual, and the patriarchy wants to keep it that way. I’m here to talk about all things #Feminasty, so ask me anything.

For a bit more information about the project and ourselves:

Feeling there was an absence of historical western graphic novels, author Mark Lee Gardner and artist Nate Olson collaborated on adapting Mark’s original book into a graphic novel.  Meticulously researched, it's about the infamous James-Younger gang who terrorized post-civil war America. It deals with such themes as humanity's capacity for good and evil. 

Mark: An award-winning historian, author, and musician, Mark Lee Gardner has appeared on the History Channel, PBS American Experience, ABC World News, AMC, the Travel Channel, NPR's All Things Considered, and BBC Radio to name a few.  He writes for both popular and scholarly audiences, such as The Daily Beast, American Heritage, Wild West, True West, New Mexico Magazine, and Journal of the West.  Mark's previous books include the critically lauded To Hell on a Fast Horse and Shot All To Hell.  He is currently researching famed Lakota leaders Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull for a dual biography. For more about Mark and his books: http://www.songofthewest.com/books.html


Nate: I’ve been working as a freelance artist for about the last five years. I've always been drawn (pun intended) towards the narrative side of art, but this is my first time working on a large graphic novel. 
     So why art? Philosophers from Plato to Schopenhauer have spoken of the power, majesty and meaning of art far better than I ever could. Just one ""for instance"" though of why I like art is it satiates my curiosity and indecisiveness. With a project like a historical graphic novel, I get to learn about another time and place, then in order to share that information I get to wear many hats. It’s like making a movie out of still images, and I research, compose, direct, light, choreograph and act all at the same time, just it's with a pencil! see some of my work follow this link: http://www.nateolsonart.com/graphic-novel/

AMA.","Hey, I'm Zach Toombs, a reporter and documentary producer for Newsy. Our latest report, Young Guns, looks at how millennials and Gen Z are buying, using, and thinking about guns very differently than older generations.

&amp;#x200B;

We partnered with the polling firm Ipsos to conduct a survey that came up with some interesting findings, like:

&amp;#x200B;

* American gun owners age 18-34 reported carrying a gun on them monthly almost twice as much as Gen X and Baby Boomers (43% to 23%)
* Younger Americans were just as likely to own guns (28%) as older generations (27%)
* Younger Americans’ support for stricter gun control laws overall is higher than support from older Americans (61% versus 53% — OK maybe that's not so surprising).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, our doc found that young gun owners are really into self-defense and concealed carry, even more than previous generations. That actually sort of makes sense when you look at larger trends (in 1999, way more people bought guns for hunting than for self-defense, but now that's flipped). As more states are opening up right-to-carry laws, that's meant more Americans are able to carry for self-defense. There's a lot of doubt from researchers over whether this actually makes anyone safer (many academics say it has the opposite effect). The doc gets into that too.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to redefine independent filmmaking for the modern age, with a direct connection between audience and filmmaker. Ask me anything!","Hello r/IAmA,

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Joel Haver and I've made movies since I was six years old. This year I graduated from film school. Throughout schooling, I learned that my strong suit was conceptualizing ambitious projects and playing into my limitations to execute them for dirt cheap. This allowed me to make three features and a webseries during my vacations and free time, capitalizing on the creative safety net allowed by school. I had tested the waters with festival submissions and distributors, but given just how cheap I was able to make movies for, it felt dishonest to go through this old world rigmarole. In a day and age where anyone can film anything and post it online, calling anything independent that jumps through extraneous hoops just to be seen began to sound like a bad joke. To avoid that bad joke, I decided to double down on my strong suit, and cut out the middle men. The logical step was to release all my work for free, in hopes that it will find an audience online.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a little about my three features and webseries! Three of which are entirely viewable now for **free** and the fourth is releasing this weekend!

&amp;#x200B;

# [We Are Sasquatch](https://vimeo.com/222848730)

*We Are Sasquatch* is my first feature film, made for just $200 with my childhood friends and family in my hometown throughout the summer of 2016. It's a mockumentary about a small town dance contest in the 90's, set in a world where Sasquatches are just hairy people who have been assimilated into human society. As one might expect, tensions between the humans and Sasquatches boil.

&amp;#x200B;

# [31 Days in Marshall, North Carolina](https://vimeo.com/286186006)

In July 2017, my friend Dylan Dexter and I went to a town we had never been to, where we knew no one, and lived in a trailer for the entire month. We had no preconceived notions and no script. While there, we made a movie with the people we met. This summer, we returned to screen the film in Marshall and over 200 people showed up from a town with a population of 800. The experience from beginning to end was amazing and I hope the film can capture that.

&amp;#x200B;

# [I'm Going to Be Famous](https://youtu.be/OMuDsueep9s)

Easily my largest scale project to date, *I'm Going to Be Famous* consists of thirteen episodes shot over eight months and chronicles my real life journey to become famous before graduating college, by means of acting, stand up comedy, rapping, performance art and getting buff. This one is a real roller coaster that was constantly at the whim of the real world, if it seems like I'm just winging it then I probably was.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself - Official Trailer](https://vimeo.com/287838929) - COMING SEPTEMBER 30TH

*Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* marks my first time writing a feature length script! It tells the story of Bud, a clueless moron, whose relationship with his girlfriend Judith comes to an abrupt end and he has to learn to move on. Shot in my freetime throughout senior year, using equipment made available to me through my schooling, this film was made for just $10. You can see *Taking a Little to Feel Sorry for Myself* two days early on September 28th by becoming a $10 Patron!

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the simple idea:** For the price of a movie ticket through Patreon, you will get early access to each movie prior to their ultimate free release. *Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* is the first movie to be using this system, but expect future releases' early access period to be more dramatic. All money raised through Patreon will go solely to bringing the next project to life. If successful, this will result in a beautiful situation allowed by the internet, where audiences can directly support the filmmakers with no middlemen. And best yet, the movies will ultimately be released for free, never permanently locked behind a paywall. So there'll be an ever-growing library of films to make the judgement call if that investment is worth it for you.

Read more about that here: [https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver](https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver)

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm able to produce for dirt cheap, these projects take forever, don't expect more than 2 a year on average! Check my Patreon for updates on projects in the works.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the future of filmmaking is one of online self distribution with a direct connection between audience and filmmaker and if no one else has the gonads to welcome in that future maybe I'll have to!

Hi [r/CanadianForces](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianForces), I'm MCpl Stuart Ayres from the Canadian Armed Forces Parachute Team - better known as the SkyHawks! The team is open to all elements and trades across the CAF, and we're recruiting teammates for the 2019 season!

Internet competition is under threat by big name telecom companies. Let's discuss what this means for YOU and ISPs including Sonic, and why there's still hope for saving broadband competition. AMA!","My name is Dane Jasper (/u/danejasper), and I co-founded Sonic in 1994, at a time when many people hadn't yet heard the terms ""internet"", ""email address"" or ""World Wide Web."" Today, Sonic is the largest independent ISP in Northern California. As a 24-year industry veteran, I've seen a lot of change, but I firmly believe that every home and business in America deserves fast, affordable internet backed with the friendliest customer care around. 

That's why I'm fighting a recent [forbearance petition](https://www.ustelecom.org/sites/default/files/documents/USTelecom Forbearance Petition.pdf) filed in May with the FCC. Lead by a lobbying group representing AT&amp;T, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Frontier, this petition could dramatically raise prices on consumers, hinder access to high-speed internet, and prevent Sonic - and other independent ISPs - from continuing fiber deployment.

I'll be sticking around to answer your questions about this petition's attack on [broadband competition](https://www.bridge2broadband.org/) and what's at stake for you and everyone else who uses and loves the internet. Ask away!

https://i.imgur.com/m6pZYEs.jpg

My name is Corina and I love boxing, traveling, cooking, my husband Bob and our dog, Ernie. I’ve lived in Philly for almost two decades after moving to the US from Venezuela. It’s been a good life and only in recent years have things changed drastically on my end.
 
In 2011, I came down with an awful sinus infection. That’s all I thought it was. The doctors couldn’t figure out why my blood pressure was through the roof or what was going on. Turns out, I had something called IGA nephropathy. I was 27 years old.
 
Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease—that rapidly progressed—wasn’t a life sentence for me. I refused to let it hold me back or get me down. I found ways to stay active, to stay positive, and to stay… myself. I didn’t want to lose a sense of myself through this diagnosis. The specialists said it could take 20 years until my kidneys would stop working. It only took 5.
 
My name is Corina, and I used to love boxing. I used to love traveling. I used to have more energy for everyday things. My husband Bob and our dog Ernie make every day a little bit easier, when I can stay awake long enough to spend time with them. Doing anything in Philly—no matter the season—is exhausting. Walking is exhausting. Talking is exhausting. Putting all of this on paper is exhausting… and terrifying, yet here I am.
 
My name is Corina, I’m 34 years old, and I need a new kidney.

My blood type is O (as in S.O.S. or O.M.G. or “O, wow that’s the universal donor blood type, so O donors are in high demand”) so that’s where things get a little trickier. 

Right now, my life isn’t the same as it used to be, and I don’t feel the same, either. But I’m still me. Still Corina. And I’m still hopeful. And I’m still patient. And a patient, too—here at Jefferson University Hospital in Philly, in case you’re local to the area.
 
To contact me directly about anything you’ve read here, please email [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com) anytime.

**EDIT**

I am truly shocked by the amount of responses I have gotten so far. Not only am I hearing from people with the same disease as mine but also people who know someone that has it and is curious to learn more. This is truly amazing!

Not only are people just generally sending positive vibes, but they're offering to get tested to donate also. I'm incredibly grateful. **If you asked me to send you a donor form in the comments, could you please email me at [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com). It's getting hard to keep track of everyone on here! (which I guess is not a bad thing!)**

To all of you with IGA Nephropathy, kidney disease or other chronic illness, I'm happy to have helped you in any way, however small. And it makes me feel a little less alone hearing a lot of you who've gone through the same and have come out the other side feeling better!

Lastly, I will try my hardest to reply to every single one of your questions. I do need to get back to work today though! So I will chip away at this every night this week. 


**EDIT #2**

I think I was able to get to all of your questions and comments tonight! 

Again, thanks to everyone for your questions, words of support and over all positivity. I saw some really great questions and interactions, and as a newbie on Reddit it was nice to see such a huge community of people ask and answer so many questions related to IgaN, kidney disease, transplant and other chronic illness. 

To all of you who offered to help. You are amazing humans. I cannot believe how many people are willing to help a stranger. I am shocked and incredibly grateful.

I am your host Eric Moreno. I am a US Submarine Veteran and the founder of r/Submarines. I am bringing you an expert panel of submariners, explorers, historians, authors, researchers, pod-casters and the US submarine rescue ""Falcon-1"" ROV pilot. Helping me with this AMA is /u/KapitanKurt (moderator of r/Submarines and r/WarshipPorn).  
   
The submarine world is one of the most unseen, unforgiving, classified, ground breaking and tight knit communities on the planet. We discover new life on almost every dedicated dive, explore the most dangerous places on Earth and even research the origin of life. Some of us live a life (akin to high security prisoners) hundreds of feet underwater, loaded with more firepower than all the WWII explosives combined, powered by a fission reactor, tasked with deterring species ending war... all while being endlessly hunted like an underwater trophy kill.   
  
A vast majority of the submarine culture nurtures mis/disinformation. All aspects of the military and civilian culture have their own secrets. This AMA is dedicated to providing a means to ask questions in a manner that is safe and comfortable for all parties.  
  
Operational security (OPSEC) is going to be maintained at the highest level to ensure the safety of everyone involved. **Questions involving classified information will not be answered.** I apologize before hand if your question doesn't get answered. Simple questions like ""How deep can you dive?"" or ""How fast can you go underwater?"" are usually classified. We get questioned about classified material all the time so don't hesitate to ask us anything. Everyone cleared to work with classified information is trained on how to deal with questions.  The panel will answer questions as they see fit and follow any procedures required of them.

This AMA is going to stay at 100% active until tomorrow due to the time differences. Everyone involved is scattered across 6 different time zones. The active submariners have unreliable schedules due to the nature of the job. We also have a few people taking business flights today. Some replys maybe delayed due to this. I will keep everyone up to date if I am informed of any delays.

I live in Ohio with my parents and 3 1/2 year old nephew.  I have a neuromuscular disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy and subsequently am in a power wheelchair. I am tracheotomy and vent dependent, and need respiratory treatments two-three times a day, which makes me need care around the clock. I also have a Gastronomy and receive continuous liquids via GT tube.

I have lived my life as a gay man, and I have published a poem called ""My Soul"", through a program called Traveling Stanzas, which allows individuals with different circumstances have a voice. I have also done art, and won an award for my Drawing class in college. With my coming degree, I wish to go into a film career (my main goal is to become a Director).

Hello Reddit! I am Zellnor Myrie, a candidate for State Senate in New York's 20th State Senate District. My district includes the neighborhoods of Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Gowanus, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, South Slope, and Sunset Park. I was born and raised here in the district by my mom, who moved to this country from Costa Rica over 40 years ago. After college, I worked in the New York City Council as a legislative director where I helped write and pass the City’s Tennant Bill of Rights. I then went on to graduate from Cornell Law School. 

I am running against former-IDC member Jesse Hamilton to represent my community as real Democrat. I believe the issues facing my community are too grave and too urgent to sit on the sidelines. My platform will expand affordable housing, fully fund our public education system, protect our immigrant communities, and reform our criminal justice system.

I will be here from 1-3 p.m. EST to answer your questions. AMA!

That's exactly what we did. AMA.,"**Office Space** came out the year I graduated from university and started my first ""real"" job. Talk about serendipity :)

At a time in my life when I most needed affirmation that it was OK to admit that cubicles and corporate ladders weren't for me, I got it. 

There had to be a better way.

And while it took well over a decade of trial &amp; error to figure it out - my wife and I are pretty confident we've finally worked out our great escape.

Almost 10 years ago now we were teaching English in Chile (we'd previously met while teaching in South Korea and also taught together in Vietnam) when it dawned on us that ESL forever wasn't going to be the right solution. Having worked for almost 7 years as a tour guide in Europe before we met, my wife suggested that we try to get into the tourism industry.

No problem.

Except how do we do that? Particularly when most jobs related to tourism are awfully low paid.

# The only logical solution was to start our own business

Not only would running our own business (theoretically) allow us to earn a decent living in tourism, it would also provide us with full control over our vacation time. We love to travel and one of our biggest fears when looking at alternatives beyond ESL was being able to find a job that would allow 2-3 months off per year. Yes, a lofty goal but our goal nevertheless.

At any rate, after toying around with a bunch of different ideas, from a traveling English school that would essentially blend a European tour bus and English camp into one to a hostel or other types of guided tours, we were open to anything. But we kept coming back to the idea of potentially opening up our own beach hotel.

It just seemed to implausible.

# Back to Korea

While we were working on the particulars we decided it was best to return to Korea where the money was better. We could start saving capital while we figure out what we wanted to do.

Slowly but surely our plans came together.

We decided on Mexico. And planned to build a very small boutique hotel where we would also provide 3 meals per day. Sort of like if a Bed &amp; Breakfast and a beach resort had a baby. 

Our concept was to provide a legitimate alternative to the giant soulless corporate resort. A place where perhaps less-adventurous travelers could both relax and have an experience that wasn't a Costco Vacation.

After 3 years of saving like maniacs - we moved to Mexico and made it happen.

# The old-fashioned way

The only problem was that we'd never built a beach resort before. 

And while we certainly had 'some' capital saved up for the project, it was a fraction of what any sane person would figure was reasonable for a project of this magnitude.

So along with our life savings, we added a whole lot of elbow grease. I made [this album](https://imgur.com/gallery/bnREQ) 4 years ago for /r/DIY and while not exhaustive, it provides a pretty good idea of our construction process.

In short, we figured it out as we went. Often using Google to teach us construction skills we needed on the fly.

# Fast forward

Long story short, after a bumpy beginning we're finally to a point where the business is relatively mature. Not exactly where we want to be numbers wise but good enough that it's no longer stressful to watch our inbox for reservations. 

We've been given a [Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g153373-d4076432-Reviews-Gecko_Rock_Resort-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html) a couple times, which is from being consistently ranked in the top 3 of your category for the year...and we get a lot of return guests, which is the ultimate compliment for all the hard work we've put in. That out of everywhere there is to go in the world on vacation, people choose to come back again with us instead of trying something new.

It's hard to believe that next month we'll be opening for our 5th full season at Gecko Rock.

Ask me anything.

Whether you’re reconnecting after the summer apart or starting a new friendship, the start of the school year is an especially important time to check in with a friend about how they’re doing. Just starting a conversation with a friend, no matter how awkward it may feel, can make a real difference in someone’s life. 

I’m Dr. Victor Schwartz and I have over 25 years of experience as a psychiatrist working in college mental health. I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine, and prior to becoming Chief Medical Officer at the Jed Foundation (JED), the nation’s leading national nonprofit organization that exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for our nation’s teens and young adults, I was the medical director of NYU’s Counseling Service, and served as University Dean of Students at Yeshiva University.

I’m Dr. Christine Moutier and after losing colleagues to suicide early in my medical career, I decided to dedicate my career to fighting this leading cause of death. As a practicing psychiatrist, professor of psychiatry, and as the Chief Medical Officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), the nation’s largest suicide prevention organization, I am focused on helping people be more open about their mental health, seeking help when they need it, and identifying ways to optimize care for those living with mental health conditions. 

Friends can usually tell when something is “off” with their friends, and they are often the first to recognize the early signs of mental health problems. They want to do something to help, but don’t always know what to say or how to start the conversation. Seize the Awkward, a campaign developed by JED, AFSP and the Ad Council, aims to encourage young adults to create a safe space for their friends to talk about their mental health, and educate them on how to have those conversations and support a friend in need. Watch the campaign videos [here,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r47l4eUU1bc&amp;list=PLdSSKSOSBh4l56j7S7HxdZPTmO5iqvKCe) or visit www.SeizeTheAwkward.org for more resources. 

We’re looking forward to answering any questions about how to help a friend who may be struggling with their mental health – ask us anything!

I got a qualification in wine at the beginning of this year, and what was formerly a love became a bit of an obsession.

I live at Twin Oaks Community, a commune started in 1967. Here I hold down multiple jobs ranging from taking local orders for our Tofu, to babysitting a 5 year old, to running chemical analysis at our sewage treatment plant.

Originally we simply wanted to buy one for each of our family so we could get around town and to the beach. While researching bikes we found they were really expensive and they also looked kind of odd. Some of the top of the line bikes were selling for $5000. This set us on a quest to build our own and now we have them ready for production.

We created e-cruzin electric bikes and have started production but figured it would be a good idea to see what everyone wants in an electric bike to verify we have all aspects covered.  Also, many people may have general questions about electric bikes and we are here to answer those as well.

I look at the cultural and historical aspects of witchcraft and hauntings – why do people want to see ghosts? How come women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft than men? When did the term witch go from dangerous insult to a signal of feminine power? More than 45,000 people were executed as witches in Western Europe, and people are [still being accused of sorcery](https://theconversation.com/can-we-learn-from-the-past-in-tackling-witchcraft-related-violence-today-102337?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitterbutton) in some countries today.

I've published articles related to the intersection of video gaming and therapy, as well as a recent op-ed in the Chicago Tribune about the recent Gaming Disorder ICD code by the World Health Organization.

 I recently combined my career as a couple and family therapist with my love for video gaming into a Twitch channel dedicated to discussing relationships and mental health while streaming some of my favorite video games. I created the channel hoping that people can find a safe, relatable space where they can discuss their relationships, ask for general advice, and find a non-judgmental community. 

My goal is to be able to eventually stream full-time so that I can provide a consistent platform for people to talk about what's most important to them in a safe space. I also hope to partner with Twitch and other streamers to help guide people in the right direction if they are seeking to attend to their mental health.

Please feel free to ask me about anything related to relationships, therapy, mental health, finding a therapist, mental health access, video gaming and mental health, etc.! 

Ethically, I cannot give specific therapeutic advice, but I can speak in general terms!

I'm Andy, a Detroit native. I started what would be a terrible business but a great social project to give kids in Detroit free scooters.

I recently signed up as a charger for Bird scooters. You might know that when a scooter is super lost they increase the bounty paid out to charge that scooter up to $20. I went into the neighborhoods in Detroit to try and find some of these ""high bounty"" scooters and what I found kinda blew my mind.

I came into a big housing complex and found about 10 kids pushing around 4 dead Lime and Bird scooters. I got to talking to the kids and they were super friendly but didn't have much of an idea why someone dropped off these scooters in their neighborhood. Scooters that light up totally look like a toy, and so what is an eight year old to do?

The trouble is that kids and lots of adults in Detroit don't have the required drivers licenses, bank accounts or money on hand to take part in this ""big cool future."" It must really suck to be a Detroit kid in the summertime and see these cool looking scooters with the lights sitting out on the street corner but you're technically not allowed to touch them unless you have the means.

So I started Play Free Bird [www.playfreebird.com](http://www.playfreebird.com) where people can send us electric and manual scooters from Amazon and we'll assemble, charge and distribute them to Detroit kids who need them. It's a small project designed to make things better. If anyone is going to drop off scooters in an urban environment like Detroit they should be accessible to everyone.

I'm open to your feedback if you have any on our project - and we'd love the support if you have the time.

PS: We got a front page story in The Detroit Free Press about our project. You can read that here: [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm\_medium=twitter&amp;utm\_source=dlvr.it](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it)

My team and I recently [published research](https://elifesciences.org/articles/37001?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMASept2018) showing how the processes involved in hair and feather development are similar to the way scales develop on fish, suggesting they may all have the same ancient origin.

I am interested in understanding why animals look the way they do. We know that the shapes of animals and their organs are genetically encoded; after all, animals tend to resemble their parents. We also know from the fossil record that the shapes of animals and their organs evolve and change radically over long timescales. So, if we can understand how genetic instructions are decoded during development to shape adult animals, we can test hypotheses regarding the evolution of form. To this end, we study the zebrafish, a small minnow that is easy to keep and easy to breed.

I’ll be here to answer questions about a [recent paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/37001?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMASept2018) we published in the journal eLife, where we found that fish scales and mammal hair rely on similar genetic mechanisms, suggesting a single origin of skin appendages in ancient fishes. It also puts forward the zebrafish and its scales as a good model for scientists to study, so they can understand better how certain hair and teeth disorders arise in humans. I’m happy to discuss these findings and our research more broadly.

I’m an animal behaviorist and I’ve spent my entire life to practicing the art of training. In addition to dogs, I’ve trained lions, bears, tiger and even insects for films such as The Hangover, The Jungle Book II and We Bought a Zoo. I’ve also spent time studying sharks on Shark Week!

I’m currently in production on Season 6 of Lucky Dog, a television show that allows me to rescue hard-to-love, out-of control, untrained and unadoptable dogs and embark on the task of rehabilitating them to become perfect pets or service dogs. It’s a perfect show for the entire family! Catch the Season 6 Premiere on CBS Dream Team, It’s Epic! September 29th. Check your local CBS listings for details.

I am the Director of the Women’s Media Center [Speech Project](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/speech-project/), which is dedicated to raising public and media awareness about online harassment. I also recently appeared in a documentary film about online harassment called [Netizens](https://www.netizensfilm.com/).

My new book [Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women’s Anger](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Becomes-Her-Power-Womens/dp/1501189557/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538146992&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rage+becomes+her) explores all of the ways women are forced to resist their rage and how this affects them in many areas of life. Since rage is really the most powerful tool we have, I urge women to embrace their anger and harness it as a tool for lasting personal and societal change.

I’d love to answer any questions about rage, but I also write and speak often about wider issues related gender, media, tech, education, women's rights, sexual violence and free speech.

Please ask me anything!

My name is Ryan, but I go by Dr\_Mick in online spaces. I'm a marriage and family therapist in the state of Illinois in the United States. I have a PhD in human development and a MS in marriage and family therapy. I am also an approved supervisor and a clinical lecturer of psychology at a local university. 

My clinical specialty includes working with all types of anxiety, with couples, and with clients who play video games. I also write academically about video gaming's impact on individuals and relationships.

I'm passionate about de-stigmatizing therapy, and about challenging assumptions about therapists. Therapists should be approachable and relatable - after all, we are people too!

Relatedly - I recently combined my love of video games with my desire to help people find a starting point for accessing mental health resources and support by hosting a Twitch channel titled *\[Game\] Sessions with a Therapist.* Though I cannot ethically provide therapy services on my stream channel, I can (and do) answer general questions, provide general guidance, help find resources, as well as talk about all sorts of things from anxiety to depression to relationship health and more. My goal is to build a community where people can feel supported by me and other viewers, and where they can chat in a space that's more accessible and relatable.

I stream nightly at 11:30pm CDT but also at other random times during the week if I get the time. **If you've ever wanted the opportunity to talk to a therapist in a more casual environment, stop by - I'd love to chat with you!**

Twitter: [@drmick7](https://twitter.com/drmick7)

edit: WOW. This blew up and I am SO grateful that so many are open to talking about this. I'm doing my best to answer questions as fast as I can! Stop by the stream - I'm live right now answering questions verbally as well!

edit 2: this has been absolutely incredible. Seriously. I want to get to every single one of you but you would not believe how swamped my inbox is! be patient with me please! And if you'd like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!

**A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It'll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I've received:**

1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there's some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a ""pro bono"" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.
2. **How do I get over \[x\] or handle my \[x\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.
3. **How do I convince \[x\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you're a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot ""force"" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)
4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you're interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)
5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it's a group of people who have been wanting the space. I'm truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it's something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It's something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.
6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple &amp; family therapist is my recommendation. If you're interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!
7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick's and others' writings about video gaming?** I don't have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel's Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It's also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.
8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you'd like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!

Unfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I've received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It's for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don't feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.

I'm still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you'd like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I'm on (pretty much) every night!

I found my birth parents in 2013 for the first time and now I'm helping others adopted around the world.

My name is Alex Gilbert and I was born in Arkhangelsk, Russia in 1992. My birth mother was unable to look after me. She herself was in an orphanage throughout her life. Little is known about exactly why she adopted me out.

My New Zealand family came and adopted my brother and I in 1994 when we were both two years old. I have since met my birth parents a few times now in Russia. My Mum and Dad always have my support and are now in contact with my birth parents in Russia.

In 2015 I created a project called I'm Adopted which helps others around the world share their stories. It has helped adopted people connect which is pretty incredible. I have spoken in Russia to several people involved with Children's Rights as well as in New Zealand at our parliament. Though nothing is being done for international adoptions between Russia and NZ at the moment, that is up to both of those countries.

I have written two books 'My Russian Side' and I'm Adopted which you can find online.I have been back to my Orphanage in Arkhangelsk, Russia. I went back in 2017 and now I hope to send gifts and supplies to my orphanage in Russia next time. That is my next project.
