Also marijuana use is heavily associated with depersonalization-derealization disorder which is fairly common among susceptible Individuals; about one in 50 people in the United States have it and you might be having some of the symptoms mixed with depression. 
It's most common in young males that use cannabis heavily, have significant life stressors, and a history of anxiety. It most commonly happens during the period of intoxication but symptoms can last for up to years.

There is no such thing as contentment was never possible. Contentment is possible for anyone. It is the cornerstone of all eastern philosophy. Look into texts of Taoism or Buddhism for accessible relevant textual support if you are seeking insight and wisdom in a human rather than spiritual context that has endured the test of time.

The state of thinking you describe of yourself  is by definition pathological and the reason why we have mental health care services. 

Symptoms like these could happen as a result of prior life trauma, prior drug use, ongoing unmanaged stress, an imbalance of neurotransmitters induced by the aforementioned over time, toxin exposure, and less often abnormal brain development, brain trauma, autoimmune disease processes, or brain tumors.

Not having desire is termed anhedonia, and this is also a common presenting symptom of clinical depression that affects nearly half of all people at least once in their lifetime.

Support services exist to help you, but you have to care to and want to be helped or others that care for you will need Toni dust upon it. Even so, cultivating a love worth living falls to you. You get one shot at this life, and that includes finding the meaning of it for yourself.

As for my explanation of what it likely means to have a soul, a significance to your existence more than the matter you are made of, you seem not to have understood the explanation I spent the effort to synthesize together for you, and I suggest you read over it again.

I wanted to pursue psychiatry as a future career and I wanted to ask what a day for you entails as a psychiatrist. I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time but I've sort of figured my way through this dark path. It hit me a couple months ago that mental health has become a passion for me and I want to help people who struggle with it in the future.

IAmA,"Fucking with us is a term that might more or less be accurate, but not very charitable and pretty dismissive of the magnitude of the concept.

I mean, I don't think most people really comprehend what religious are talking about when they talk about gods... these are beings which are the fucking creators of the universe. Yes, this whole show is their fucking plaything. If we were capable of understanding a god perfectly, we would BE gods.

Atheists and agnostics - at least ones in western civilization - tend to, without realizing it, anthropomorphize god. They tend to view god as a sort of person just like them, because we were ""made in his image"" according to western religious canon. But ""made in his image"" is a seldom understood line and is in fact much more vague than it seems; the canonical scriptures of western religion that most people would be familiar with do not define this statement with any rigor at all. And so atheists think of god as just some bloke who happens to have all the power - they think that's what religious people think. Perhaps that IS what many religious people think! But the canonical writings of western religion make it clear there is a vast gulf between god and man - not just in power and nobility, but in character and composition as well.

A programmer writes a program to do something for her. Let's say she's a great programmer and could write a program that is a copy of herself in every way... but that would mean the software copy of herself is going to have to do whatever it is the programmer wanted to avoid doing herself in the first place - and in a real sense, that means the programmer has accomplished nothing. So the programmer writes a simpler program; one that can do the job without caring about doing the job. Is the programmer ""fucking with"" the code? Certainly; but most of the time we would just call that ""getting work done"" unless we had a chip on our shoulder about the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note, I think you'll find that faith as religious people define it is EXACTLY what you say it is, couched in terms that take the issue more seriously. Faith is distinct from knowledge for religious people - one does not only believe the sun will rise tomorrow - one *knows* it. And the difference between faith (belief without knowledge) and knowledge (belief based on knowledge) is absolutely crucial in western religious canon. ",4,e6bfy3d

IAmA,"Can you clarify what you mean by people punishing others for ""accidentally, inadvertently or due to their own beliefs identify someone using a pronoun the recipient doesn't agree with"" because this seems like a strawman of how non-binary and trans people actually respond to people who misgender them.  
   
I've listened to a few people who identify as non-binary on podcasts and videos (they use they/them, not xer or what are considers ""tumblr pronouns"") and the way they explain how they handle pronoun usage is similar to the way I've heard a lot of trans people do it. Essentially, a few accidental misgenders, especially if the person knew them before they identified differently, they will generally forgive them, but if it's not taken seriously, or continuously done deliberately, the person most likely doesn't respect the person's decision to identify differently and they may cut them off, which I don't see how that's unreasonable. If someone repeatedly kept calling me something I didn't want to be called, even if they thought it wasn't a big deal, I'd be pretty pissed off about it. I imagine I'd be even more upset if they kept calling me something that in my mind invalidated who I was.  
  
Sure, that doesn't speak for every non-binary or trans person as some are probably less forgiving than others, but surely you can at least emphasize with wanting people to recognize and respect who you are. And if you don't give a shit? Fine, but you don't have to ascribe it to a nefarious ""progressive agenda"", nor do you have to perpetuate the Peterson garbage that somehow this tiny group of people are getting laws passed that punish people for misgendering them ""accidentally"" or not recognizing them.",4,e5oo07h

Do I deny that Mohammed ""united the warring tribes""? Absolutely. Islamic tribes war to this day (the opposite of unity), often over disagreements in interpretations over what Mohammed did or didn't say or do.

  


Do you credit specific country leaders with uniting the warring countries after WWI or WWII? I dont. The cycle of inter-country violence was not broken, and nobody was united. Countries keep warring, just like tribes keep being tribey and even continue warring. No individual deserves anywhere near 50% credit for the macro processes that drive temporary peace. Individuals dont unite groups or change their warring nature, large forces do. If war is no longer inevitable (and that's not yet clear), I credit economic and social interconnectedness due to technology, not any specific people. For example, incremental improvements from lots of people to solar energy efficiency and cost and energy storage efficiency and cost would make the world much more peaceful, at least for a while. Most of the economic and armed conflict are at the heart over control of energy, which for a while has been oil. Even Genghis Khan doesnt deserve much credit for the Mongol Empire. Freak sunshine put an unusually large amount of energy in the plants and animals for several decades leading up to Genghis's birth.
