For a bit more information about the project and ourselves:

Feeling there was an absence of historical western graphic novels, author Mark Lee Gardner and artist Nate Olson collaborated on adapting Mark’s original book into a graphic novel.  Meticulously researched, it's about the infamous James-Younger gang who terrorized post-civil war America. It deals with such themes as humanity's capacity for good and evil. 

Mark: An award-winning historian, author, and musician, Mark Lee Gardner has appeared on the History Channel, PBS American Experience, ABC World News, AMC, the Travel Channel, NPR's All Things Considered, and BBC Radio to name a few.  He writes for both popular and scholarly audiences, such as The Daily Beast, American Heritage, Wild West, True West, New Mexico Magazine, and Journal of the West.  Mark's previous books include the critically lauded To Hell on a Fast Horse and Shot All To Hell.  He is currently researching famed Lakota leaders Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull for a dual biography. For more about Mark and his books: http://www.songofthewest.com/books.html


Nate: I’ve been working as a freelance artist for about the last five years. I've always been drawn (pun intended) towards the narrative side of art, but this is my first time working on a large graphic novel. 
     So why art? Philosophers from Plato to Schopenhauer have spoken of the power, majesty and meaning of art far better than I ever could. Just one ""for instance"" though of why I like art is it satiates my curiosity and indecisiveness. With a project like a historical graphic novel, I get to learn about another time and place, then in order to share that information I get to wear many hats. It’s like making a movie out of still images, and I research, compose, direct, light, choreograph and act all at the same time, just it's with a pencil! see some of my work follow this link: http://www.nateolsonart.com/graphic-novel/

Personal Credit: Maxing points for a mortgage, rebuilding after a $h!* pickle, credit card debt Business Credit: With and without your personal guarantee","Here to answer questions about credit, rebuilding after a  $h!\* pickle, debt negotiation, negative remarks on your credit report, dealing with creditors, why your scores can vary 150 points from different places, which score are your real scores, business credit with or without your personal guarantee, credit with romantic partners...any of it. 

**I'm a nerd,** so I've dug deep into the scoring models to figure out how to get the most points and create the most leverage.

My family lost our farm that had been in our family for 100 years in the 2008 crash and I've rebuilt my life and my credit and now I help other people do the same. Trial by fire. That story on the [DailyWorth](https://www.dailyworth.com/posts/4380-helping-my-dad-put-me-in-debt).

After that experience I've made it my life's work to leverage business credit so that people don't have to go through what we went through.

I have a new program coming out about building credit in your business name, without your personal guarantee.

I've done my fair share of raising money for a business, so feel free to ask about SBA loans, friends and family rounds, angel investing, VC, private or hard money, structured finance, etc. I also have a deep love of slow money strategies.

I've got a free video course over on [my website](https://wealthgenerationcollective.com/) that will give you custom advice about what to get better personal credit. None of that generic pay your bills on time. Yes, you should pay your bills on time, but that will only give you a 10-20 point jump.  I go over some of the counterintuitive things, like when you should apply for more credit, even right before you get a mortgage.

I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice. That also means I can tell you things that lawyers sometimes won't. I'm US based, but Canada has similar systems.

The Machine has been described as ""the most powerful fraternity in America"" and its tentacles reach to the State House, Washington and beyond. Ask us anything!","EDIT: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today! 

Hello! We're journalists Amy Yurkanin and John Archibald — we co-hosted an investigative podcast for Reckon by [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) called Greek Gods - on [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/alcom/reckon-radio) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reckon-radio/id1420215603?mt=2).

The podcast tells the story of a powerful secret society at the University of Alabama called 'The Machine,' which has controlled campus politics for more than a century and whose power extends to the State House, Washington, and beyond.

The Machine — known to members as Theta Nu Epsilon — serves as a training ground for Alabama politicians, schooling them in the political dark arts. It has spawned numerous governors, senators, and others. Even those who have opposed The Machine, including MSNBC 'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough and current Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, go on to political careers.

In the podcast, we delve into the organization's methods — including threats of violence, wire-tapping, boycotts, voter coercion, and more — and speak to those who've reported on the Machine and the people whose lives were affected by it.

Ask us anything!

I’m John Archibald, a columnist for the Alabama Media Group, which includes the Birmingham News, the Huntsville Times, the Mobile Press-Register, [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) and the social phenom [Reckon](https://www.facebook.com/ReckonAL/).

[You can read my stories here.](http://connect.al.com/staff/jaarchib/posts.html)

 I’ve covered everything from crime and punishment to Birmingham City Hall, which is not always the same thing. I grew up in Alabama, went to the University of Alabama and found my life and my wife at the student newspaper there. I have three grown children who left me with their three dogs.

**Amy:**

I’m Amy Yurkanin, co-host and producer of Greek Gods. I live in Birmingham, Ala. with my husband, two kids, cat and lizard. We moved to Alabama from Las Vegas, where I wrote for an alt-weekly and also produced a talk show for the local NPR affiliate.

[You can find my stories here](http://connect.al.com/user/AmyYurk/posts.html).

After I recovered from the culture shock of moving from Sin City to the Bible Belt, I began to become interested in the Machine – the secret society that shaped the careers of my colleagues, John Archibald and John Hammontree. Greek Gods was my first foray into podcasting, but hopefully not my last.

Hey, Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

We are Holly Jones &amp; Ola Denslaw, Tech Recruiters in the JavaScript contract space at [Venturi](https://www.venturi-group.com/). Ask us Anything! We are based in Manchester, UK and will be answering questions from 11am GMT.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this AMA because as tech recruiters, we are often asked by our network if we can help with CV reviews/edits, interview tips, the pro's of contracting, tech market intel and hopefully put to rest any negative connotations that may be associated with the recruitment industry.  We’ve put aside 4 hours today to have a Q&amp;A and answer all of your questions!

&amp;#x200B;

About us:

Holly – I have worked in the JavaScript recruitment space for 3 years, and now recruit contract developers in Manchester. I enjoy being involved and contributing to the tech community in Manchester and have recently launched Venturi Code Camp where myself and the team are learning to code through FreeCodeCamp and have begun the foundations of our own webpage.

&amp;#x200B;

Ola - Originally from Poland, I came to the UK at the age of 17 to study Criminology at University in Liverpool. I was always fascinated by technology which is how I got drawn towards recruitment particularly in the tech space, I now specialise in recruiting within Development&amp; Design space in London with a primary focus on the JavaScript market.  What I love about the contract market is how diverse it actually is and that I get to speak to so, so many interesting people every day!

I am interested in understanding why animals look the way they do. We know that the shapes of animals and their organs are genetically encoded; after all, animals tend to resemble their parents. We also know from the fossil record that the shapes of animals and their organs evolve and change radically over long timescales. So, if we can understand how genetic instructions are decoded during development to shape adult animals, we can test hypotheses regarding the evolution of form. To this end, we study the zebrafish, a small minnow that is easy to keep and easy to breed.

I’ll be here to answer questions about a [recent paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/37001?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=AMASept2018) we published in the journal eLife, where we found that fish scales and mammal hair rely on similar genetic mechanisms, suggesting a single origin of skin appendages in ancient fishes. It also puts forward the zebrafish and its scales as a good model for scientists to study, so they can understand better how certain hair and teeth disorders arise in humans. I’m happy to discuss these findings and our research more broadly. AMA!",9h6o1t,0,t5_2qzb6

713,1537297746,IAmA,Insomnya3AM,773,5074,I'm Andy! I launched a terrible business idea to give kids in Detroit free electric scooters.,"Hey reddit:

I'm Andy, a Detroit native. I started what would be a terrible business but a great social project to give kids in Detroit free scooters.

I recently signed up as a charger for Bird scooters. You might know that when a scooter is super lost they increase the bounty paid out to charge that scooter up to $20. I went into the neighborhoods in Detroit to try and find some of these ""high bounty"" scooters and what I found kinda blew my mind.

I came into a big housing complex and found about 10 kids pushing around 4 dead Lime and Bird scooters. I got to talking to the kids and they were super friendly but didn't have much of an idea why someone dropped off these scooters in their neighborhood. Scooters that light up totally look like a toy, and so what is an eight year old to do?

The trouble is that kids and lots of adults in Detroit don't have the required drivers licenses, bank accounts or money on hand to take part in this ""big cool future."" It must really suck to be a Detroit kid in the summertime and see these cool looking scooters with the lights sitting out on the street corner but you're technically not allowed to touch them unless you have the means.

So I started Play Free Bird [www.playfreebird.com](http://www.playfreebird.com) where people can send us electric and manual scooters from Amazon and we'll assemble, charge and distribute them to Detroit kids who need them. It's a small project designed to make things better. If anyone is going to drop off scooters in an urban environment like Detroit they should be accessible to everyone.

I'm open to your feedback if you have any on our project - and we'd love the support if you have the time.

PS: We got a front page story in The Detroit Free Press about our project. You can read that here: [https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm\_medium=twitter&amp;utm\_source=dlvr.it](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/09/18/bird-scooters-take-off-detroit-one-guy-wants-make-them-free/1333342002/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it)

Ask Us Anythine!","Tommy: I started climbing soon after I  learned to walk. Growing up with a mountain guide father, my talent and passion led me as a teenager to the top of climbing competitions and cutting-edge outdoor routes. In 2000, on a climbing expedition in Kyrgyzstan, my partners and I were captured and held hostage by armed rebels. Miraculously, after six days of captivity, our group managed to free ourselves. Upon returning to the United States and trying to piece together my life, I severed my index finger in a home remodeling accident. Managing to overcome the obstacles life was throwing at me, I came back stronger. My free climbing accomplishments in Yosemite National Park remain unmatched and made my one of the best rock climbers in the world, a perfect contender to be the first person to free climb The Dawn Wall.
 
Kevin: Like most kids, I grew up climbing ladders, trees and fences, until a visit to my local climbing gym changed my life forever. I steadily improved my climbing and started winning youth national championships. Once I discovered bouldering, I quickly made a name for myself as one of the sport’s best. At my home stomping grounds in the California’s Buttermilks, I made the first ascent of the terrifying Ambrosia, a 15-meter high boulder from which a fall near the top would be catastrophic. While searching to expand into other climbing disciplines, I learned about Tommy Caldwell’s initial forays on the Dawn Wall. Under the mentorship of Tommy, I proved a quick study as I transformed myself into a big wall climber capable of the completing the most continuously difficult route in the world.

I was the Executive Producer for the Pornhub Awards Show that took place on Thursday night, which featured Kanye West as Creative Director!

I am also the CEO and owner of Utherverse Digital and HoloFilm Productions; two world leading VR companies in the CG VR space and filmed/streamed VR space respectively.

I hold more than 50 patents on technology innovations in numerous areas, including many that have allowed Virtual Reality tech to become realized.

My company was primarily responsible for the Kanye West Pornhub Awards Show, and we provided all the virtual reality components including RedLightCenter.com as the platform for attending the show in a virtual world with no headset required, and Oasis.game for attending the show using VR headsets.

I have also produced and directed more than 200 VR movies and scenes for HoloGirlsVR (adult) and HoloFilm Productions (everything non-adult).

I was the Executive Producer of The Pornhub Games reality show hosted by Asa Akira.

I am a law professor and political activist. Two years ago, I ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then the chair of the Democratic National Committee, in the August 30, 2016 Democratic primary that's still mired in controversy since the Broward County Supervisor of Elections illegally destroyed all the ballots cast in the primary. I was motivated to run against Wasserman Schultz because of her fundraising and voting records, and particularly her close ties with big Wall Street banks, private insurers, Big Pharma, predatory payday lenders, private prison companies, the fossil fuels industry, and many other big corporate interests that were lobbying for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In this rematch, it's exciting to run as an independent in a district that's less than 25% registered Republicans. I have pledged to take no PAC money, no corporate donations, no SuperPACs. My campaign is entirely funded by small donations, mostly online at:  [https://timcanova.com/](https://timcanova.com/) We have a great grassroots campaign, with lots of volunteer energy here in the district and around the country!

In my youth, I was a pacifist who evaded serving in the French military. But decades later while I was working in Britain, I was taken aback to see that the rebellious behavior leading to my deferral remained in a my French personnel file. I needed it to be updated before I could return home to France to work after ten years and the only way to clear my dossier was to be re-evaluated and join the French military. In a surreal series of events, I found the French, British, and Israeli Secret Services were all interested in me. In the end, I decided to serve in the medical corps of the French army as a way to settle my debts with the military. So, In my mid-fifties, I became a liaison emergency doctor in war-torn Afghanistan.

My memoir offers a unique perspective on the conflict in Afghanistan, how war is waged and about the medical challenges presented by the expansion of terrorism into Europe and the United States.

American author Jessica Levine translated my memoir into English from the French version will also be joining the conversation.

Helping me with this AMA is /u/KapitanKurt (moderator of r/Submarines and r/WarshipPorn).  
   
The submarine world is one of the most unseen, unforgiving, classified, ground breaking and tight knit communities on the planet. We discover new life on almost every dedicated dive, explore the most dangerous places on Earth and even research the origin of life. Some of us live a life (akin to high security prisoners) hundreds of feet underwater, loaded with more firepower than all the WWII explosives combined, powered by a fission reactor, tasked with deterring species ending war... all while being endlessly hunted like an underwater trophy kill.   
  
A vast majority of the submarine culture nurtures mis/disinformation. All aspects of the military and civilian culture have their own secrets. This AMA is dedicated to providing a means to ask questions in a manner that is safe and comfortable for all parties.  
  
Operational security (OPSEC) is going to be maintained at the highest level to ensure the safety of everyone involved. **Questions involving classified information will not be answered.** I apologize before hand if your question doesn't get answered. Simple questions like ""How deep can you dive?"" or ""How fast can you go underwater?"" are usually classified. We get questioned about classified material all the time so don't hesitate to ask us anything. Everyone cleared to work with classified information is trained on how to deal with questions.  The panel will answer questions as they see fit and follow any procedures required of them.

This last July, thanks in large part to Reddit, I was able to hang one of my pieces at the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Ops Center. AMA!","Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2017 I took the plunge and quit my comfy, corporate front-end web-dev job to attempt to live out my dream of shooting landscape / astro-landscape photos and making &amp; selling prints full time. I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) ""following"" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn't be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.

&amp;#x200B;

Proof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I've had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my ""[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)"" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously ""[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)"" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.

&amp;#x200B;

As an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!

&amp;#x200B;

Using all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying.  Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I  [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it's a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing &amp; selling art, or whatever's on your mind. I'll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn't be here without you!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Hey guys and gals, this has been a boat load of fun but I've got to get back to work for a bit. Please feel free to keep firing the questions and I'll answer as many as I can later this evening. Thanks again Reddit, I love you.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: No, not related to Bill Cosby. No, you can't run in my lobby. And yes, this is classic Schmosby right here.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2 - 9/6/2018: Just one more edit. I want to say thank you so much for the Reddit Gold to the two of you who sent it my way! I was up late last night trying to reply to as many comments as possible, and I'll get through even more of them today, and thank you to all the commentors as well. If I don't reply to your specific question by the end of the day today it probably means that it was answered multiple times elsewhere in the thread, so poke around a bit, or feel free to shoot me a pm once my inbox cools off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I've mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron's line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there's another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to ""stack"" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, when you're first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site!  Google the ""Rule of 500"" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they'll still be cool and it's great practice!

&amp;#x200B;

If you're just getting into astro landscape photography, it's much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I'll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)

&amp;#x200B;

A solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you'll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!",9d8hsu,2,t5_2qzb6

4904,1537568777,pokemon,srstable,13,5,Wish to play through as many of the generations on one device as possible!,"Hello, all! I’m a fan of Pokémon and have been dedicatedly playing Pokémon Go of late, but have come to the conclusion that having NO IDEA who some of these Pokémon are is starting to become a little frustrating. So, I’d like to pick up either a New 2DS XL or New 3DS XL, whichever, and play through as many of the generations as possible. 

What I would like from you more dedicated fans is an understanding of the best way to do this. I’ve heard there’s supposed to be a way to bank some Pokémon from one generation to another and possibly carry of your Pokédex. As someone who has a great love for Mewtwo, not taking advantage of that seems silly. 

So with that in mind, how would you best recommend going through with this? One game per generation is the goal, save for BW/B2W2 as I understand they’re direct sequels. I have no objection playing through remakes to accomplish the same task. 

Any help is appreciated!",9huo22,0,t5_2qmeb

We all have that little city where we fell in love with something. May it be its atmosphere, his unique background music, the history behind it, or just the nostalgia. My most loved city in the pokemon universe is without any doubt the Mossdeep city, in the third pokemon Gen, Ruby and Sapphire.
As a long term pokemon player, I play pkmn games since Red/ Blue came out, I passed through all the graphic changes, from mono sound to stereo cd quality and till this day, none of the newer versions touched my heart as Ruby/ Sapphire.
The graphic change was incredible, richer colors, the Sound Track of the game became more captivating with all the trumpets, drums and peaceful musics, the game was amazing with all the mechanics, new ways to ride your bike, new environments like damps, deserts, vulcanic ashes, also some of the great new pokemon designs like Groudon, metagross, Deoxys, Salamence and many others.
But when I though that I was getting about the end of the game, after a long trip surfing in the blue ocean of the hoenn region, I've reached this unknown city, with a rocket station, a psychic gym with twins leaders, strange trees and the birth place of one of my favorite characters in the game, Steven!
The houses have a unique architecture there, the  city music is so great that it blends with the feeling of comfort and heat from there, it was amazing for me at the time.

So what about you guys? I'm really looking forward to hear your experiences of nostalgia with this amazing game! ",9gc3ki,0,t5_2qmeb

I think one of the worst design, by the look of the Pokémon, is Musharna. Yes, it's supposed to be a sleeping Pokémon and dream mist (or something like that) is coming out of it's forehead. To me, Musharna looks like a fetus with the umbilical cord still attached.

Also Sawk and Throh. They're just dudes with karate suits on.

There has been a lot of talk about shinies and how it will work in the game with no good answer. There is a japanese YouTube channel going by the name ""brother4 channel"", they got to try the game out early and in their demo play there was a shiny Weedle in the wild (picture is a screen grab from video). So all the talk about not being sure if the pokemon are shiny in the overworld/wild was answered 2 weeks ago when the video was uploaded. I do expect some people must have seen the video by now, but because there has not been any proper article (as of what I have seen) talking about the video I thought I would post it here for people to see. [Link to video and start at 3:40 where the shiny will be seen.](https://youtu.be/k203YlIR7eo?t=220) The shiny is on screen for 6 seconds before they encounter a non shiny pokemon. Hope this post helps a little bit for those that did not know.

What annoys me about this line is that it's usually used to justify certain directions the core series is taking (as opposed to the side games which can have their own tones and be more softer/harder if they so choose). I see this a lot in response to people complaining about the changes made in Gen VII and especially in regards to Let's Go and what people are calling the ""dumbing down"" of the series and that the games are being made significantly easier in order to bring in a new audience or the casual crowd. The series has always been geared towards children and I played Pokemon Red when I was 9 so I have to ask what makes the more recent games so special? Why are people talking about the series being aimed at kids /now/ when they were always aimed at kids and were much less hand-hold-y in the past. When you try to justify the changes made in more recent games as ""Well, they're for kids"", I feel it's a massive disservice towards both the series and kids in general. Kids aren't idiots, if I (and all the people who played Red/Blue back in the late 90s) was able to complete the game with little to no help from either the game or the internet (since I had no real access to it then) then how come we act as if all the choices made in Gen VII and Let's Go are for the benefit of kids who might not know how to play the games.

I watched the TV series religiously as a child, but I've only played Leaf Green (beat the E4 once), White (finished the story), Y (900 hours or so), and most of Omega Ruby (up to getting Primal Groudon). I'm planning to change that soon.

I'm planning on buying one of each Pokémon generation, and playing through them all. I'm planning to go Red, then Gold, then Ruby, then Pearl, then Black, then Black 2, then X, then Sun, then Ultra Sun. After that I'd likely play the remakes (HG, FR, AS, and LGP when it comes out), and maybe the third versions (Yellow, Crystal, Emrald, Platinum). I hope to finish in time for the 2019 Pokémon release on the Switch.

Is it worth playing both the ""main"" version and then the third version, or should I just replace the first with the third (e.g. Crystal instead of Gold)?

Is there any reason I should play the games out of order? I'm a little concerned about jumping into the first release, with no ""quality of life"" updates, right off the get-go, but I feel like slowly descending into it (going last to first) would be worse.

Any other tips would be appreciated as well!

Canonically, are there any non-legendary Pokemon besides Pikachu who are so consistently impressive in battle? Obviously Team Rocket (JJM) usually lose but the Wob actually does really well regardless. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I just saw the episode ""Same Old Song and Dance"" (243) and in one of the battles Wobuffet takes down Phanphy, Poliwhirl, and Jigglypuff (another very strong battler) with his Counter attacks, enabling Team Rocket to get away. Or in the episode, ""Wayward Wobuffet"" Wob easily dispatches Goneff's Golem with his counter attack, and Golem's have been shown at times to be strong physical battlers. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Now I know that in the video games Wobuffet is considered an Uber and one of the strongest battlers (some would say he is extremely unfair because of his Shadow Tag ability) but how strong actually is Jessie's Wobuffet compared to other Pokemon in the anime?
