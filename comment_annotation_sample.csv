I am MTF trans and have never transitioned in any way pretty much exactly because of what you mentioned.

So yes, I am one person who just deals with it for that reason.

I can also say without a doubt that it is the biggest regret in my entire life. Even though I can live a perfectly normal and happy life as a man, I no longer want to. I'd honestly rather be dead than keep living as a man, and the only reason I'm still alive is because I'm just too lethargic and unmotivated to kill myself. I'm currently trying to talk to a therapist about transitioning just to improve my mental health.

My ex-husband took his own several years ago. He was always a bit mentally disturbed, and was diagnosed with BPD and had PTSD from a very abusive childhood.

He never looked into getting treatment for himself and tried to use all sorts of drugs and drinking to soothe himself. 

My questions are, did some of these drugs (mushrooms, LSD and cocaine) lead to more depression and suicidal tendencies?

Also, I didn't notice until it was too late but his behavior in the weeks before he hanged himself had changed dramatically. He was  sorry for his own abusive behavior toward me and others in his family and said he loved us even though he didn't show it much, and he wanted to meet with me and try to straighten things out with me. I accepted his apology but I made it clear I didn't want to be with him again.

So my other question is this, was his apologies and wanting to smooth things over with me a cry for help? Or do you think he would he have gone through with his suicide anyway had I responded differently? So if this happens again with someone else I love I can help prevent it.

65698,IAmA,"For me, I felt really uncomfortable with my male body. I was somewhat masculine - more of a nerdy guy - and I was fine acting the way I felt most comfortable (bar repressing my urge to crossdress), even if it meant my mannerisms were a bit feminine at times. When my grandfather complimented my shoulders on getting broader I had to cry in the toilet for a while in mourning of my frame. Facial hair and body hair felt disgusting. My voice didn't feel like me. Absolutely hated my genitalia - feeling it against my leg was almost Lovecraftian, like being touched by something that shouldn't be able to touch you. I was afraid of even touching it when I was a child. My flat chest caused me a lot of freakouts. I knew I wasn't comfortable with a male body. Hearing ""he"" and stuff was always a little uncomfortable jolt in my head, a reminder of what I was and what I didn't have. 

At the same time, I had this feeling that I ought to have been born a girl. It's a bit hard to describe. You know how you know you're attracted to girls or boys, if you aren't bi? You can feel the attraction, but you can't really prove it, or say why you feel that way, or determine how it arose. You just know that you're attracted to X and not Y. I felt the same - I just knew I ought to have been a girl, that I wished to be a girl, that I should have been one, that I would be 'right' or 'more me' as a girl. Imagining myself with a female body felt like a good thing. Seeing myself looking like a girl once or twice in pictures or my reflection had me absolutely enraptured until the spell broke, at which point I'd go and cry and wish I was dead. 

This feeling of preference or knowing of what ought to be was something natural and intuitive to me. When I was six I read Animorphs, where teenagers fight aliens by touching animals and turning into copies of said animals. If they stay as animals longer than two hours, they're stuck as that animal forever. My first thought was to touch my female cousin and then be her twin sister forever.

Now I've been taking cross-sex hormones for a year. I've got breasts, and they feel normal to me. They're not distressing or disturbing like my flat chest; they feel as normal as my fingers and toes. My skin is softer and it's amazing rather than freaky. My dick barely works and I've never disliked it less. I have a curvier shape and I think it looks great rather than freakishly boxy and male. Having a body with female characteristics feels normal and unremarkable and comfortable to me. I also just really like being seen as a girl rather than a guy by people. 

So, yeah, that's how I knew I was trans - discomfort with male body, comfort with female one. I know I didn't just want to be feminine because I didn't really care about being feminine growing up. I know I'm not agender because I have a specific comfort/normalcy state and other states that aren't comfortable, which I think is what indicates my gender. ",e5ovmz9

You forget the source?  Perhaps you imagined it.  

&gt; Also phytoplankton would adapt. They aren’t super complex and while most might die natural selection will favor those that are better in warmer environment.

Natural selection generally takes place over very extended periods (millennia) and isn't usually factored into the survivability rate for a relatively sudden and extreme disaster.  For example, if a comet crash destroyed the dinosaurs it wouldn't typically be said that they went extinct due to the inherent weaknesses or flaws of the species.  Similarly, the quickness which environmental changes are currently happening are akin to the speed of an asteroid strike in terms of evolutionary/geological time.  If conditions change abruptly and phytoplankton dies off in ten or twenty years... it's unlikely that new forms of phytoplankton will evolve fast enough to balance things out.  

&gt; The planet has been warmer before and life tends to find a way.

Sure, but most species that have ever existed have died off.  And most people aren't talking about the complete end of all life on Earth when they're talking about the current mass extinction.  ",e66j9sx

28617,science,"&gt;I imagine it would become pretty hard to have a BMI of 20 with a bodyfat much over 26% though, considering that's towards the lower end of healthy.

It's really not, that's the main issue. It commonly under-rates and over-rates people to extents that are unacceptable for judging individuals.

---

Take a look at this chart for example - it shows many BMI results and what they average out to. The average looks fine and shows a correlation that people with higher BMI's are fatter on average but the blue dots are all over the place - a huge percentage of them are being under or over rated by large amounts.

https://i.imgur.com/rtfvlGL.png

A LOT of people have a body fat percentage of both 15% and 25% with a BMI of 22 on that chart for example. The line between fit and obese is blurred.

---

If somebody has a BMI of 23 then they are more likely to be fatter than somebody with a BMI of 21, there is a clear correlation there. The problem is that they're not overwhelmingly or even highly likely to be fatter, there are so many people with a BMI of 23 that have a lower body fat percentage than other people who have a BMI of 21.

You also cannot say that you have a BMI of 23, therefore your body fat percentage is 21% - it could be 16, 26% or anywhere in between without you being an *extreme* outlier. Lots of people with 16% and 26% body fat have a BMI of 23 and you don't know if that error is there or which direction it's in. Both healthy and obese people exist at this BMI, and this just averages out to saying that you're probably kinda overweight, neither healthy or obese. You probably are. Maybe. The kind of scientific statement that you could make from this would be, rough made up example.. something like that 75% of people with a BMI of 23 have a body fat percentage between 18 and 24%.

That's good for some scientific studies but if somebody says ""Hi, my BMI is X, what should i do to improve my health?"" the first step is to grab a tape measure and assess their physical state by eye. It's quite highly likely that they deviate significantly from the mean body fat percentage for that BMI.

Shit like Ratatta with a 255 catch rate have a 1/3 chance of being caught with a normal ball at full health, but catch rates usually decrease as Pokemon evolve. Raticate's got about a 1/6 chance and Golbat's at 11% or something.

Even when using Razz Berries and Ultra Balls in Go, starters are still fucking nightmares to catch, and even then they have the decency to not attempt to flee until after they break out.
