IAmA,"We are Tommy Caldwell, a climber who spent 6 years climbing The Dawn Wall, and Kevin Jorgeson, a boulder who turned big wall climber after joining Tommy on The Dawn Wall. Ask Us Anythine!","Tommy: I started climbing soon after I learned to walk. Growing up with a mountain guide father, my talent and passion led me as a teenager to the top of climbing competitions and cutting-edge outdoor routes. In 2000, on a climbing expedition in Kyrgyzstan, my partners and I were captured and held hostage by armed rebels. Miraculously, after six days of captivity, our group managed to free ourselves. Upon returning to the United States and trying to piece together my life, I severed my index finger in a home remodeling accident. Managing to overcome the obstacles life was throwing at me, I came back stronger. My free climbing accomplishments in Yosemite National Park remain unmatched and made my one of the best rock climbers in the world, a perfect contender to be the first person to free climb The Dawn Wall.
  
 Kevin: Like most kids, I grew up climbing ladders, trees and fences, until a visit to my local climbing gym changed my life forever. I steadily improved my climbing and started winning youth national championships. Once I discovered bouldering, I quickly made a name for myself as one of the sport's best. At my home stomping grounds in the California's Buttermilks, I made the first ascent of the terrifying Ambrosia, a 15-meter high boulder from which a fall near the top would be catastrophic. While searching to expand into other climbing disciplines, I learned about Tommy Caldwell's initial forays on the Dawn Wall. Under the mentorship of Tommy, I proved a quick study as I transformed myself into a big wall climber capable of the completing the most continuously difficult route in the world.

 One of the sites we look after is Stonehenge, perhaps the world's most famous prehistoric monument. It was built in several stages, with the Stone Circle erected in about 2500 BC.
 
 2018 is a special year for Stonehenge, marking 100 years since the site was gifted to the nation.

 Hello Reddit! I am Zellnor Myrie, a candidate for State Senate in New York's 20th State Senate District. My district includes the neighborhoods of Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Gowanus, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, South Slope, and Sunset Park. I was born and raised here in the district by my mom, who moved to this country from Costa Rica over 40 years ago. After college, I worked in the New York City Council as a legislative director where I helped write and pass the City's Tennant Bill of Rights. I then went on to graduate from Cornell Law School. 
 
 I am running against former-IDC member Jesse Hamilton to represent my community as real Democrat. I believe the issues facing my community are too grave and too urgent to sit on the sidelines. My platform will expand affordable housing, fully fund our public education system, protect our immigrant communities, and reform our criminal justice system.
 
 I will be here from 1-3 p.m. EST to answer your questions. AMA!

 https://i.imgur.com/m6pZYEs.jpg
 
 My name is Corina and I love boxing, traveling, cooking, my husband Bob and our dog, Ernie. I've lived in Philly for almost two decades after moving to the US from Venezuela. It's been a good life and only in recent years have things changed drastically on my end.
  
 In 2011, I came down with an awful sinus infection. That's all I thought it was. The doctors couldn't figure out why my blood pressure was through the roof or what was going on. Turns out, I had something called IGA nephropathy. I was 27 years old.
  
 Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease that rapidly progressed wasn't a life sentence for me. I refused to let it hold me back or get me down. I found ways to stay active, to stay positive, and to stayâ€¦ myself. I didn't want to lose a sense of myself through this diagnosis. The specialists said it could take 20 years until my kidneys would stop working. It only took 5.
  
 My name is Corina, and I used to love boxing. I used to love traveling. I used to have more energy for everyday things. My husband Bob and our dog Ernie make every day a little bit easier, when I can stay awake long enough to spend time with them. Doing anything in Philly no matter the season is exhausting. Walking is exhausting. Talking is exhausting. Putting all of this on paper is exhaustingâ€¦ and terrifying, yet here I am.
  
 My name is Corina, I'm 34 years old, and I need a new kidney.
 
 My blood type is O (as in S.O.S. or O.M.G. or â€œO, wow that's the universal donor blood type, so O donors are in high demandâ€) so that's where things get a little trickier. 
 
 Right now, my life isn't the same as it used to be, and I don't feel the same, either. But I'm still me. Still Corina. And I'm still hopeful. And I'm still patient. And a patient, too here at Jefferson University Hospital in Philly, in case you're local to the area.

 **EDIT**
 
 I am truly shocked by the amount of responses I have gotten so far. Not only am I hearing from people with the same disease as mine but also people who know someone that has it and is curious to learn more. This is truly amazing!
 
 Not only are people just generally sending positive vibes, but they're offering to get tested to donate also. I'm incredibly grateful. **If you asked me to send you a donor form in the comments, could you please email me at [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com).

 To all of you with IGA Nephropathy, kidney disease or other chronic illness, I'm happy to have helped you in any way, however small. And it makes me feel a little less alone hearing a lot of you who've gone through the same and have come out the other side feeling better!
 
 Lastly, I will try my hardest to reply to every single one of your questions. I do need to get back to work today though! So I will chip away at this every night this week.

 For a bit more information about the project and ourselves:
 
 Feeling there was an absence of historical western graphic novels, author Mark Lee Gardner and artist Nate Olson collaborated on adapting Mark's original book into a graphic novel. Meticulously researched, it's about the infamous James-Younger gang who terrorized post-civil war America. It deals with such themes as humanity's capacity for good and evil. 
 
 Mark: An award-winning historian, author, and musician, Mark Lee Gardner has appeared on the History Channel, PBS American Experience, ABC World News, AMC, the Travel Channel, NPR's All Things Considered, and BBC Radio to name a few. He writes for both popular and scholarly audiences, such as The Daily Beast, American Heritage, Wild West, True West, New Mexico Magazine, and Journal of the West. Mark's previous books include the critically lauded To Hell on a Fast Horse and Shot All To Hell. He is currently researching famed Lakota leaders Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull for a dual biography. For more about Mark and his books: http://www.songofthewest.com/books.html
 
 
 Nate: I've been working as a freelance artist for about the last five years. I've always been drawn (pun intended) towards the narrative side of art, but this is my first time working on a large graphic novel. 
  So why art? Philosophers from Plato to Schopenhauer have spoken of the power, majesty and meaning of art far better than I ever could. Just one ""for instance"" though of why I like art is it satiates my curiosity and indecisiveness. With a project like a historical graphic novel, I get to learn about another time and place, then in order to share that information I get to wear many hats. It's like making a movie out of still images, and I research, compose, direct, light, choreograph and act all at the same time, just it's with a pencil! see some of my work follow this link: http://www.nateolsonart.com/graphic-novel/",4,9hs18u

 Relatedly - I recently combined my love of video games with my desire to help people find a starting point for accessing mental health resources and support by hosting a Twitch channel titled *\[Game\] Sessions with a Therapist.* Though I cannot ethically provide therapy services on my stream channel, I can (and do) answer general questions, provide general guidance, help find resources, as well as talk about all sorts of things from anxiety to depression to relationship health and more. My goal is to build a community where people can feel supported by me and other viewers, and where they can chat in a space that's more accessible and relatable.
 
 I stream nightly at 11:30pm CDT but also at other random times during the week if I get the time. **If you've ever wanted the opportunity to talk to a therapist in a more casual environment, stop by - I'd love to chat with you!**

And if you'd like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!
 
 **A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It'll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I've received:**
 
 1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there's some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a ""pro bono"" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.
 2. **How do I get over \[x\] or handle my \[x\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.
 3. **How do I convince \[x\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you're a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot ""force"" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)
 4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you're interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)
 5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it's a group of people who have been wanting the space. I'm truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it's something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It's something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.
 6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple &amp; family therapist is my recommendation. If you're interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!
 7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick's and others' writings about video gaming?** I don't have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel's Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It's also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.
 8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you'd like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!
 
 Unfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I've received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It's for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don't feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.
 
 I'm still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you'd like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I'm on (pretty much) every night!

IAmA,"I'm Frank Blake, former CEO of Home Depot, now I'm telling inspiring stories about people who do amazing things for others. AMA!","Hello Reddit,
 
 It's great to be here with you today!
 
 My name is Frank Blake -- I was the chairman and CEO of Home Depot for seven years. Now I tell inspiring stories about people who do amazing things for others on the [Crazy Good Turns podcast](https://crazygoodturns.org/).
 
 One of the powerful lessons I learned at Home Depot was you get what you celebrate. When you celebrate people who do something right, the results are usually more good work by that person and others. The Crazy Good Turns podcast is bringing that idea to the world at a larger scale. If we celebrate those who do good deeds, will we see more of them? If you hear a story about an inspiring person doing something amazing for somebody else, will you try to be a little better too? We invite you to join us on the journey and see.
 
 Before we get started, here are a couple of my favorite podcast episodes:
 
 [Team Rubicon](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/team-rubicon/)
 
 We've heard too many times the stories of military veterans struggling to find a place in the civilian world. Jake Wood of Team Rubicon unites the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams.
 
 [The Gift](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/the-gift/)
 
 In this episode we did something a little different, you hear five stories of incredible gifts or acts of kindness. One of the five stories that stood out for me was the story of Janis Martinez, who caught fire at the age of two and was saved by a trucker who was willing to donate his skin for a skin graph.

IAmA,"I'm helping to develop an international storytelling residency in a remote Korean village, ask me how it's going","Hi folks, my name is Sam, I'm a member of the K-Storytelling Foundation and if you watch Korean TV, you might be familiar with my face. [Here's](https://goo.gl/Bv3Nfp) some proof, it's all in Korean but that's kind of unavoidable. Chances are that won't play outside of Korea, so [here's](https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=ur60K_1537841889) a recording of a recording.
 
 I'm not alone, though! There are others from Australia, Vietnam, and we're eagerly expecting another Filipina storyteller to join us in a few hours. We've been here for three weeks now, and the program runs for the full month of September. Aren't we [stylish](https://i.imgur.com/sXVD3Vf.jpg)?
 
 The region Sachon is based in is called Gyeongsangbuk-do. Despite having some of the country's more populated cities, people have been leaving the area for several years, and there's real concern that some villages are going to just vanish off the map entirely.
 
 Several local schools in Sachon have closed and been reopened as community centers, there are currently 12 students in the whole village, down from a high of 1,000. The reasons for this are the same reasons for population crashes in other industrialized Asian countries, the cost of educating a child in such a competitive environment have skyrocketed beyond the reach of most families, so people are putting off marriage and child-rearing for economic concerns.
 
 One of the hopes for attracting international storytellers is to have them work a few hours each week educating area students, which should attract young parents to the village. The average age of the village is getting very near 50, without an influx of new blood there's the very real possibility that Sachon will become a literal ghost town.
 
 The regional government has actually been extremely active in preventing this, in years past they have helped construct two museums celebrating the history of the area, both as an agricultural powerhouse and as a hotbed of resistance against the Japanese occupation during the Imjin war. The house I'm staying in is actually immediately adjacent to a beautiful museum celebrating the â€œUiseong Uibeong,â€ the â€œUiseong Righteous Militiaâ€ which was comprised largely of Confucian scholars.
 
 There are a LOT of Confucian schools in the area, and they're some of the most breathtakingly beautiful architecture I've ever seen. It's beyond gorgeous, like stepping onto the set of a historical drama. When it rains I keep expecting to see women in silk dresses gazing wistfully out across the horizon, but that's just because I'm a sucker for wistful gazes.
 
 If you happen to be a storyteller, the hope is to run 4-5 month-long residencies each year, with different themes. If that sounds like something you'd want to take part in, [follow us online](https://www.facebook.com/KStorytellingWorldTourProject/) for details on how to apply!
 
 Also, we're going to be livestreaming a show on the 28th featuring some of our stories, and a performance by a traditional Korean musician. Feel free to [ask us questions](https://www.facebook.com/events/2153242884718121/) about the program or Korea in general!Last but not least, enjoy this [cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/LWa2Pcf.jpg).

This last July, thanks in large part to Reddit, I was able to hang one of my pieces at the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Ops Center. AMA!","Hi Reddit,
 
 
 
 In January of 2017 I took the plunge and quit my comfy, corporate front-end web-dev job to attempt to live out my dream of shooting landscape / astro-landscape photos and making &amp; selling prints full time. I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) ""following"" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn't be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.
 
 
 
 Proof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)
 
 
 
 I share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I've had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**
 
 
 
 In addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my ""[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)"" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously ""[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)"" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.
 
 
 
 As an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!
 
 
 
 Using all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying. Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it's a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.
 
 
 
 Ask me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing &amp; selling art, or whatever's on your mind. I'll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn't be here without you!

 **Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I've mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron's line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there's another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to ""stack"" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.
 
 
 
 That being said, when you're first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site! Google the ""Rule of 500"" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they'll still be cool and it's great practice!
 
 
 
 If you're just getting into astro landscape photography, it's much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I'll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)
 
 
 
 A solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you'll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.
 
 
 
 That's all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!",2,9d8hsu

I am independently producing and directing a feature documentary, called YOUTH v GOV, about 21 brave youth who are leading this groundbreaking lawsuit against the US government over their constitutional rights to a healthy climate.
 
 
 
 **YOUTH v GOV is the story of America's youth taking on the world's most powerful government.**Â In 2015, 21 young plaintiffs, ages 8 to 19, filed suit against the U.S. government asserting a willful violation of their constitutional rights. YOUTH v GOV follows this legal battle as the government takes extraordinary measures to get the case dismissed.Â Legal experts call this case the â€œmost important lawsuit on the planet,"" but it's more than just a legal battle.
 
 **The heart of this film lies in the young plaintiffs' personal stories as they find their footing as leaders and come to know their power as citizens in our democracy.**Â YOUTH v GOV highlights and explores youth activism, government responsibility, our constitutional rights, and the importance of citizen democracy. It's about the hope and action that our youngest generation is bringing to the forefront as they realize the power in their experiences and voices. Their story will resonate with audiences of all ages with the unexpected result that we will all be learning from our youngest how to be active, engaged democratic citizens once again.

Today, Sonic is the largest independent ISP in Northern California. As a 24-year industry veteran, I've seen a lot of change, but I firmly believe that every home and business in America deserves fast, affordable internet backed with the friendliest customer care around. 
 
 That's why I'm fighting a recent [forbearance petition](https://www.ustelecom.org/sites/default/files/documents/USTelecom Forbearance Petition.pdf) filed in May with the FCC. Lead by a lobbying group representing AT&amp;T, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Frontier, this petition could dramatically raise prices on consumers, hinder access to high-speed internet, and prevent Sonic - and other independent ISPs - from continuing fiber deployment.
 
 I'll be sticking around to answer your questions about this petition's attack on [broadband competition](https://www.bridge2broadband.org/) and what's at stake for you and everyone else who uses and loves the internet. Ask away!

The Machine has been described as ""the most powerful fraternity in America"" and its tentacles reach to the State House, Washington and beyond. Ask us anything!","EDIT: Thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today! 
 
 Hello! We're journalists Amy Yurkanin and John Archibald   we co-hosted an investigative podcast for Reckon by [AL.com](https://www.al.com/) called Greek Gods - on [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/alcom/reckon-radio) and [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/reckon-radio/id1420215603?mt=2).
 
 The podcast tells the story of a powerful secret society at the University of Alabama called 'The Machine,' which has controlled campus politics for more than a century and whose power extends to the State House, Washington, and beyond.
 
 The Machine   known to members as Theta Nu Epsilon   serves as a training ground for Alabama politicians, schooling them in the political dark arts. It has spawned numerous governors, senators, and others. Even those who have opposed The Machine, including MSNBC 'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough and current Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, go on to political careers.
 
 In the podcast, we delve into the organization's methods   including threats of violence, wire-tapping, boycotts, voter coercion, and more   and speak to those who've reported on the Machine and the people whose lives were affected by it.

IAmA,We are USA TODAY Network photographers who used a drone to cover Hurricane Florence devastation from above North Carolina. Ask Us Anything!,"The USA TODAY Network is using drones to expand its newsgathering efforts and provide more storytelling tools to give the audience a better experience.
  
 In the field while using the drone to gather aerial photos and videos, there are two FAA Part 107 Certified pilots for every flight. One pilot is controlling the drone's flight and the other pilot is controlling the camera. Communications between the two pilots is crucial to obtaining the images we need. Photographers Tariq Zehawi and John Meore worked as a drone team to capture Florence devastation from the sky.
  
 Tariq Zehawi has been a staff photographer for The Record and [NorthJersey.com](https://www.northjersey.com/) since 2000. You can follow him on Instagram [@tariqzehawi](https://www.instagram.com/tariqzehawi/).
  
 John Meore serviced as a Navy Photographer in the 80s, spent 20 years in the photo industry in technical, service and sales roles. He began working freelance in 2008, and was later hired as a staff photographer at The Journal News/[lohud.com](https://www.lohud.com/) in the lower Hudson Valley of New York.

IAmA,I'm Paolo Cattaneo. I've been travelling solo on my motorcycle for the past 3 years. I've explored almost the totality of Australia and the Americas; heading now for the old continent. AmA !!,"Hey Reddit! 
 My name is Paolo. I'm 37yo and 3 years ago i quit my IT job in Australia and started travelling solo on my motorcycle.
 I haven't stop since.
 I spent a year roughly, going all around Australia and then i shipped my motorcycle to South America and started riding up from there. 
 I recently reached Alaska and came back to Vancouver, so now i'm planning my route towards Europe and across Asia to reach Australia again, to complete my round the world trip.
 I post one picture a day. 
 All my pictures are taken with my cellphone but I carry a drone as well.
 
 I've also been sponsored by some brands that sell motorcycle gear and equipment.
 I do NOT get paid to travel and i've been sustaining myself just with my savings, accumulated with few years of work.
 
 Before I left for this trip, I always wondered how people that did these kind of things (travelling for long periods of time) were actually able to do it. 
 So, here i am, hopefully answering some question and making myself useful in this sense for others that may have the same questions i had, before i started my journey.

IAmA,"I am Soraya Chemaly, director of the Women's Media Center Speech Project and author of Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger.

I am the Director of the Women's Media Center [Speech Project](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/speech-project/), which is dedicated to raising public and media awareness about online harassment. I also recently appeared in a documentary film about online harassment called [Netizens](https://www.netizensfilm.com/).
 
 My new book [Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Becomes-Her-Power-Womens/dp/1501189557/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538146992&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rage+becomes+her) explores all of the ways women are forced to resist their rage and how this affects them in many areas of life. Since rage is really the most powerful tool we have, I urge women to embrace their anger and harness it as a tool for lasting personal and societal change.
 
 I'd love to answer any questions about rage, but I also write and speak often about wider issues related gender, media, tech, education, women's rights, sexual violence and free speech.
 
 Please ask me anything!

 In doing this work, I've had to learn the ins and outs of each state's laws and make sure that our online voter registration portals, our members who run on-the-ground voter registration drives, and our messaging strategy are completely compliant with the complexities of voter registration rules and regulations as a not-for-profit, 501c3. 
 
 Today is National Voter Registration Day! Since 2012, every year on the fourth Tuesday of September, hundreds of thousands of first-time voters register to vote on this day. It's an amazing celebration of our democracy -- a time for all Americans to come together and get ready to vote.

pokemon,Unused Eeveelutions possible stats,"So, with the new games about to drop and the possibility (and hopes) for a new eeveelution to show up, I threw together a table showing up what I think would the possible stats be for each of the types that were not still used for Eevee's evolutions . 
 
 I actually used the types stats from this imgur post ([https://imgur.com/gallery/7wAPO](https://imgur.com/gallery/7wAPO), all credits to u/AeroTheManiac for the images and reddit post) to determine the stats distribution for each of the types still unused, with the template of the current eeveelutions we have, meaning, based on this post's stats distribution, which stat would be 130 base, which stat would be a 110 base and so on, and this is what I came up with! 
 Also, for the Normal type evolution, I actually just took Eevee's base stats and gave them a boost, so that the normal type evolution would still have the same 525 base stat total of every other evolution while still maintaining a ""unique"" feel to it so that it may be viable for some use, I don't know..

 Also, for comparison and easy of view, these are the stats of the current eeveelutions we have:
 
 [Actual eeveelution stats](https://i.redd.it/46utk146ihm11.png)
 
 What is actually really nice to see is that no eeveelution have the same base stats distribution of another, real or not, meaning each and everyone of those would really be unique and be able to bring something new to the table! 
 Just by looking at it fast, I can see that a fighting type Eeveelution would be a beast for an all out physical attacker with some bulk to take a hit or too with that 95 HP stat. The ghost type one I also find really interesting! This goes to show that most eeveelutions would be really good offensively, mainly on the physical side of things. 
 Also, keep in mind that the source I used didn't have the gen 7 Pokemon yet, but I don't think the overall overcome would change so much with the addition of the gen 7 Pokemon. 
 
 
 I'd like to know what you all think about it, what would be the changes you would make to some of these types, possible abilities and uses for competitive or casual and such!

pokemon,The Pokemon Marathon has been a wild ride thanks to the Twitch chat. Thanks for the wonderful moments.(LONG),"TLDR: Pokemon marathon has been such an amazing ride, and it's all because of Twitch chat. Makes the show 10x better. Go watch it now!!
 
 I've been watching the Twitch marathon this whole week. I saw almost all the episodes. The movie just finished, so now I just want to recap on how amazing this stream has been with the chat.
 
 I've never really used Twitch prior to this summer. Eventually I started watching Smash streamers like ZeRo and Nairo, and eventually started watching more iconic streamers like Greekgodx, Andy Milonakis, and of course Tyler1. I wasn't going to watch the Pokestream initially, but eventually I decided to give it a go. 
 
 I haven't watched the Pokemon anime in years. I stopped around the release of the Black and White anime around 2012. But I still watched the original Indigo League episodes back when I a kid. Upon re-watch, I didn't even realize the jokes that I was too young to understand. But what stood out was watching it with 45 thousand people. 
 
 Watching the marathon with chat was like watching it with a concert crowd. Constant spam, PogChamps and LUL's plastered on the wall of messages. It's so fun. Of course, there are memorable moments. The PogChamps when Charmeleon evolved into Charizard, the Jebaited's when Team Rocket tricked Ash and friends, the Kreygasm's when a mildly attractive girl showed up, and the KappaPride spam whenever James dressed up as a girl. But there were two amazing moments for me.
 
 The first was when Ash released Butterfree, Primeape, and (almost) Pikachu. There was nothing but &lt;3 and BibleThumps. That would continue for the next 5 minutes. Made the release way more emotional. The other moment was whenever Team Rocket made their monologue and when the Main Theme played. Chat spammed copypasta of the monologue and the theme. It definitely hyped up what was yet to come.
 
 I only type this because I think I'm done with the marathon. I only wanted to watch until the First Movie, which airs today. Classes start anyway so today is a good place to stop. I might watch a little bit of the Orange Islands, but nothing past that. It's been such a fun ride. If you aren't watching the stream, go watch it now. And to those who are going to watch the whole series, I hope you have as much fun as I did. :)",4,9celgn

 So far, Tapu Koko will be a basic round mug with it's designs, Tapu Bulu will be one of those big tiki cups that are for luaus, and Tapu Lele is going to be a lidded teacup. If anyone has ideas and maybe some reference pics, I'd be eternally grateful.",1,9ji2qq

We all have that little city where we fell in love with something. May it be its atmosphere, his unique background music, the history behind it, or just the nostalgia. My most loved city in the pokemon universe is without any doubt the Mossdeep city, in the third pokemon Gen, Ruby and Sapphire.
 As a long term pokemon player, I play pkmn games since Red/ Blue came out, I passed through all the graphic changes, from mono sound to stereo cd quality and till this day, none of the newer versions touched my heart as Ruby/ Sapphire.
 The graphic change was incredible, richer colors, the Sound Track of the game became more captivating with all the trumpets, drums and peaceful musics, the game was amazing with all the mechanics, new ways to ride your bike, new environments like damps, deserts, vulcanic ashes, also some of the great new pokemon designs like Groudon, metagross, Deoxys, Salamence and many others.
 But when I though that I was getting about the end of the game, after a long trip surfing in the blue ocean of the hoenn region, I've reached this unknown city, with a rocket station, a psychic gym with twins leaders, strange trees and the birth place of one of my favorite characters in the game, Steven!
 The houses have a unique architecture there, the city music is so great that it blends with the feeling of comfort and heat from there, it was amazing for me at the time.
 
 So what about you guys? I'm really looking forward to hear your experiences of nostalgia with this amazing game!",3,9gc3ki

pokemon,Bug Pokemon are actually vertebrates that convergently evolved invertebrate features,"I have a feeling everyone will be shocked by this. I however, have noticed, that every Tumblr who does Pokemon Headcanons (I follow a lot), say that bug types are in fact oversized invertebrates with the organs that their real counterparts have. Bug types have confused me a lot in general. 
 
 They were clearly based off invertebrates, obviously. But they're also very big, even Joltik is big for a bug, and most of them seem to have a body structure more like a vertebrate (Scolipede seems more like a horse than a centipede, and a lot of bugs have a humanoid-ish body like Volbeat, Illumise, and Leavanny). I was debating on whether they were invertebrate or vertebrate from like 2015 until this year, I mean most of their structures really lean towards vertebrates honestly but again they're bugs so I would still like to think they could just be oversized invertebrates.
 
 This year, I finally made my choice. **Bug types are in fact vertebrates, to me at least.** I in fact think possibly all of the bug types ~~definitely not Shedinja, it's still a shell~~ are vertebrates, as I said before most of them seem to have a vertebrate body structure, and even the ones that don't are too big. Some people explain the size of bug types is because the Pokemon world has tons of oxygen, allowing for bigger bugs (the same thing happened on Earth like 300 million years ago when there was tons of oxygen in the atmosphere and land arthropods got big), but I still think they are more likely vertebrates due to so much evidence. I think they have all the vertebrate organs, and they all have bony skeletons (along with most of them having that hard exoskeleton). They just convergent evolved the invertebrate features, making them seem like insects. I wouldn't describe what exact type of vertebrate they would be, but seeing as most live on land, definitely something related to the mammal, bird, and reptile Pokemon. Maybe reptile since Flygon, a dragon-like creature, is in the bug egg group.
 
 I'm sorry if I'm wrong on this, I think I possibly am, I haven't looked at much of the Pokemon stuff in the games or anime despite myself still being into Pokemon (wow, dumb me). Most people would probably disagree with me, if you do it's okay I'll respect your opinion, this is what I think. Some would argue that the reason why bug Pokemon would have so much vertebrate features is because every Pokemon is humanized and made familiar for the audience, well those features overly showed to me and meant a lot to the Pokemon, even I couln't ignore them. Even though most people who do Pokemon biology say bug types are oversized invertebrates, weirdly enough most of my friends say bug types do seem like vertebrates.",2,9dasfh

pokemon,I Am About To Take On The Elite 4 in Pokemon Silver With One Magikarp,"Over the past week, I have been streaming a Magikarp only run of Pokemon Silver, my most favorite title in the series. The inspiration for this run came from Jrose11's video ""Is it Possible to Beat Pokemon Red/Blue with Just a Magikarp?"" 
 
 These are the rules for this run
 
 1. You can only use one Magikarp, no evolutions or multiple Magikarps in your party are allowed. You may catch Pokemon to be HM slaves to progress the story
 
 2. If you have another Pokemon in your party and run into a Pokemon that can use roar to swap out your Pokemon, you must restart the battle. So make sure that you only keep your HM Pokemon with you when you need them!
 
 3. Save states are allowed, but not in mid battle. This rule is something that I would like to potentially abolish in the future, but would be incredibly difficult to do without. I didn't use save states in the beginning of this run, but ran into a problem where I would lose battles, and also lose all of my money, which also greatly reduces the speed of this run. But I figured if you save before a battle and lose, you could just as easily reset and try again as you could on any Game Boy. 
 
 4. You may use items during battle such as X Attack, Dire Hit, etc etc. 
 
 5. No glitches of any kind are allowed. 
 
 6. Silly names are not required, but are encouraged! 
 
 I began the run by hacking a Magikarp into the beginning of the game after choosing Cyndaquil (Because your rival will counter with Tododile.) The only other issue with your rival, is that he obtains a Ghastly along the way, so if you want to beat him, you have to use a dang'ole struggle sweep! (Or elixers, but those will be important later on.) 
 
 So far, one of the most troubling parts of this run, was fighting against Morty, the all ghost type gym leader. Since you can only attack ghost pokemon with struggle as Magikarp, it took me about 3 hours of training and getting good rng to take him down when I got to his gym. 
 
 As of right now, I have just beat the 8th gym, and am on my way to the Pokemon League. I've spent countless hours training my Magikarp up to its current level of 62, which I know will still not be enough to take on the Elite 4. This week will consist of constant training and mental preparation for the oncoming battles. So far, I have put about 40 hours of in game time on this run, and am expecting much more to come!
 
 If you'd like to see my current run of this game, I stream it every day on twitch around 8-10PM EST

pokemon,I am starting a living dex and wanted to share it with everyone.,"Hi everyone! I decided to start from Gen 1 and go to Gen VII filling in a living dex. I don't know if it is currently possible since some of the pokemon were event only pokemon but I am going to fill in as much as I can while I wait for the next gen to come out. 
 
 Now, I know that I can get many if not most of the pokemon in US/UM right now but that is not my goal. I already have one living dex but I completed that a long time ago and wanted to challenge myself to do it again where I start back at my beginnings and work up to the current gen.
 
 That being said I do have some rules for me to make this a little more challenging but still keep it fun.
 
 1. All pokemon must be caught legitimately. (I.E. no gameshark or other hacking.)
 2. No using glitches to get pokemon or items.
 3. Every Pokemon must be nicknamed.
 4. You cannot obtain pokemon from anyone other then yourself. In game trades are not allowed. (This means I must play multiple iterations of a generation to ""catch 'em all"".
 5. Touch trade is allowed.
 6. Gifted or bought pokemon in game don't count towards in game trades. (i.e. Porygon from the Game Corner)
 7. Event pokemon can be used to fill the dex. (i.e. Special pichu to get Celebi in HG/SS)
 
 I want this to be a legit living dex with many if not all of them caught in their original region. I know I can get mew from 4th gen and many of the legendary pokemon show up in US/UM but they are going to be an exception rather than the rule. 
 
 
 
 If anyone is interested in my progress I have a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjeeq9S-nXhdUAGSpDqtomsZkPYrsSiSfNsRsLiBM70/edit?usp=sharing) with all the Pokemon names in it as well as type and then where I caught them and what name I gave them. 
 
 Any ideas or suggestions on how to streamline the process or any other words for me I would love to see them!

pokemon,"I've been bested... A story of love, growth, discovery, and Pokebank shenanigans.","TLDR: I've been playing ORAS with the love of my life, and she absolutely destroyed me, and I love that Pokemon constantly surprises us and brings us closer together in unusual ways!
 
 Cut to about two months ago. My fiance tells me she wants to play Pokemon. Reduces stress, something to do during the commute, etc. Okay, I've got a blank copy of Alpha Sapphire and a semi complete copy of Omega Ruby. I get this funny idea, partially inspired by the rival Brendan/May of the ORAS series. 
 
 The rival constantly checks your privilege. 
 
 ""Oh, you just beat so and so? Nice, take a look at my Grovyle!"" Proceeds to kick your butt with Leaf Blade, eight miles from the nearest Pokemon Center. They forced you to grind for a bit. They forced you to innovate, to predict what would come next. Then by the end of the campaign, your rival is something of a friend, someone who's watched you grow this entire time, and that struck home for me when I first played it. I decided to be Brendan to my fiance's May. 
 
 First battle goes about the way you'd expect. I chose Mudkip, she chose Torchic. 
 
 I brought Poochyena, she brought Lotad. I swept. 
 
 Keep in mind, I've played these games since I could talk. Since I could poop on my own. Pokemon is a way of life. To her it was stress relief. 
 
 The next fight is a little tougher, after some coaching, some analysis and hint dropping. Suddenly, Mightyena can't keep up with Combusken. Suddenly Shroomish isn't keeping pace with Lombre. Suddenly Marshtomp is getting clobbered by Kirlia! 
 
 What do I do? I can't let her get ahead of me!
 
 I invest. I move over a level one Larvesta for my fire type. A level one Bagon for my dragon. I catch an Aron. I dump Mightyena in favor of Absol, grinding outside Fortree for one with Megahorn. 
 
 And I win. Totally blindsided her, winning in a 5-0. Triumphant, filled with pride, I look at her and she just smiles at me. 
 
 ""Good job."" 
 
 Oh... I just messed up... I really messed up. I took away the thrill. I jumped myself ahead just to get a *win*. All this time, after six badges and hard won victories against Norman, Flannery, Archie, she just wanted to keep up with me. And I cheated. 
 
 I slowed down. I took my time. I gathered items I knew I didn't need. We walked through Shoal Cave together, we fought Groudon/Kyogre together. I knocked Groudon out cold, but she took her time with Kyogre, and I knew it. What did I care, I had Volc and Salamence by then! 
 
 The final battle approached. I transferred over one more that I knew I would need, at this point realizing that my Mence was too OP. 
 
 She texted me the next day. 
 
 ""I beat him. I beat Steven."" 
 
 I replied with a GIF of Raffiki, ""It is time!"" 
 
 Final battle territory, 6v6, Single Battle rules, everyone's set to level 50. 
 
 Breloom goes out, and Mega Blaziken counters. I switch to Swampert. She slams me with a blaze kick to the face. I can take it. Go Mega Swampert, and Latias comes in. Friggin Latias!!! 
 
 Of course I failed the predict and used EQ, to which she responds with a Draco Meteor from hell itself, bringing Swamp to 34 HP. Latias Flies, Aggron switches in. Latias runs, and Blaze comes back in. After a cheeky predict, I thought Aggron could take Blaze after an Autotomize. 
 
 He couldn't. 
 
 One after another, our Pokemon countered each other, switching in and out, back and forth, until at last, at the end of our ropes, Blaziken came in and wiped my Breloom. All I had left was Swampert, the poor thing. Two Megas, our starters, our longtime friends and companions, duking it out one last time. 
 
 Blaziken took me down with Sky Uppercut. 
 
 This all happened minutes ago, so forgive the dripping sap from this post, but I just can't help but feel nostalgic. 
 
 Throughout the years, we've seen rivals, gym leaders, Totem Pokemon jumping ahead with artificial levels, fake movesets, unearned buffs, crit hax and all sorts of bull. 
 
 I transferred over the most powerful Pokemon I could think of. And my fiance destroyed me. 3-0. Raikou, Volcarona, Mega Swampert in rain, Super Luck Absol, none of them stood a chance. And maybe after 20-something years of playing this game, I've grown complacent. Maybe after seeing her slow crawl through what I thought was a simple campaign, I thought nothing could stand in my way. I would show her. I could keep being that Pokemon Master. 
 
 I've never been so glad to be so wrong. 
 
 Maybe after 20 years of playing this game, keeping it to myself, I've come to think of myself as the expert. Maybe after every defeat, we begin to learn something about ourselves as Trainers. Maybe after 5 years of loving this beautiful woman, I'm awestruck that she brought to bear her willpower and genius that I've envied for so long, and absolutely put me in my place. What I love about this game, and what I think she's come to love about it too, is how often it can surprise us. How often we can be so sure of ourselves, and lose. And how every loss comes with the knowledge that the person before us, the person who looks at you with a big shit eating grin on their face when your Swampert goes down to Mega Blaziken, is someone who gave their all, who devoted their time and energy to their friends. Their team. To this game, probably more than you did, even with the benefit of PokeBank and EV training. 
 
 Seriously, how the hell did she beat me? 
 
 At the end of the day, and it's about midnight here, the time you put into your team, the effort you put into training them... It doesn't come close to the love you feel for that person who beat you. You want to know them. You want to know why, and how, and maybe that's scary, but you know that you have a long way to go. And after beating me, she held out her DS and said, ""More! Plug in another!"" 
 
 ""Another, what?"" 
 
 ""Another game! I want to play another one!"" 
 
 That's probably the best feeling of all. That the adventure isn't over yet. 
 
 Please congratulate u/thesparkawingdiamond for becoming a true Pokemon Master. 
 
 
 Maybe next time I'll bring a Sand Team...",3,9fyx6n
