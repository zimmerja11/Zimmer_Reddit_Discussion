Earlier this morning, I was struck with an idea. Some three or so years ago, a friend and I did a versus race where we each used a Random Pokémon Generator to get six randomly selected Pokémon, then we genned in those six at the first Pokémon center and that was our team for the rest of the journey. I don’t remember our exact teams, my friend did get stuck with a hoothoot that couldn’t evolve, which was pretty nice.

Anyways, I wanted to replicate this sort of run, but instead of using a Pokémon Generator, I’d like to ask the people of r/Pokémon instead. If you’d like, go ahead and drop any pokemon that you’d like me to use down in the comments for my Alola journey (doesn’t matter what region it’s from). In about a week or so, I’ll come back and select the top six, and I plan to keep track of which Pokémon gets the most/least kills, deaths, crits, etc., so that when I’m finished, I can come back and display who preformed best and worst.

Thanks for participating; I’m ready for what could be quite a memorable run.

What annoys me about this line is that it's usually used to justify certain directions the core series is taking (as opposed to the side games which can have their own tones and be more softer/harder if they so choose). I see this a lot in response to people complaining about the changes made in Gen VII and especially in regards to Let's Go and what people are calling the ""dumbing down"" of the series and that the games are being made significantly easier in order to bring in a new audience or the casual crowd. The series has always been geared towards children and I played Pokemon Red when I was 9 so I have to ask what makes the more recent games so special? Why are people talking about the series being aimed at kids /now/ when they were always aimed at kids and were much less hand-hold-y in the past. When you try to justify the changes made in more recent games as ""Well, they're for kids"", I feel it's a massive disservice towards both the series and kids in general. Kids aren't idiots, if I (and all the people who played Red/Blue back in the late 90s) was able to complete the game with little to no help from either the game or the internet (since I had no real access to it then) then how come we act as if all the choices made in Gen VII and Let's Go are for the benefit of kids who might not know how to play the games.

then i thought draco meteor is a really popular move, even on pokemon who aren't specially offensive. so i want something like that for ice types but maybe even better so we can get pumped about something being ice type cause we know it'll be in the exclusive club that can learn it.

anyway here are some idea i had though rather than new move's they're mostly just retypings of existing moves:

a ice type variant of inferno and zap cannon, has 50% accuracy and 100% to freeze and maybe 80 base power to keep the pattern going but it's probably enough as just a status move.

a version of seed flare, has 40% chance to drop a target's stat 2 stages, maybe make the stat random. idk if it needs 120 power but at this point i think the ice type might deserve it

a version of head smash with better accuracy

something between clanging scales and v-create

a new move that sets up hail and a new terrain that slows non ice types, boost the power of ice type moves

i'm really just interested in a 50% freezing move like the 1st thing i mentioned, seems like it'd be worth  having an ice type on your team for despite how frail they are, but what are your ideas? that's why i made this messy post.",,9cac8s,,0,,false,1540063449,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,1-2 kalosflair 685,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9cac8s/come_up_with_a_move_only_and_all_natural_ice/,,sweet!!,false,Discussion,

1535899997,pokemon,Ragnowrok,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9cclin/some_interesting_new_challenge_run_rulesets/,0,5,,,Some interesting new challenge run rulesets,"Pokémon is a timeless game, but for a lot of people, after many playthroughs the main story may start to get a little too easy. While Nuzlockes are a very fun way to spruce up the challenge, they get a little old after a while, and honestly sometimes even Nuzlockes can feel a little underwhelming. So here are some extra rules that you can add to your Nuzlockes or even just normal playthroughs to take the challenge up to the next notch. I’m sure some of these you’re very familiar with, but I hope at least one catches your eye as something you could try. Personally, I always use rules 1-4 when Nuzlocking and I’ve tried all the rules from 5 beyond at least once so they definitely are possible.

1) No Healing / X Items During Battle- This is a common one, but I really think it adds a lot of depth and strategy to a Nuzlocke run. Ordinarily, the idea for me would be to get a Pokémon that doesn’t get 2 hit KO’d, boost with x items and repeatedly heal with items and then proceed to sweep. While this works, there’s not much depth to using this same strategy every time and I really like this restriction.

2) Level Limit- Again, a common idea, but setting a level limit to ether the highest level Pokémon of the next major boss, lowest level Pokémon maybe if you want a challenge or anything else again helps bolster the strategy in the game rather than relying on brute force and over leveling to win battles.

3) No Deposits- Not allowing yourself to deposit any Pokémon into the PC forces yourself to use the weaker Pokémon you catch in a Nuzlocke that you wouldn’t she otherwise rather than immediately depositing them when you find someone stronger.

4) Set Battles- It levels the playing field between you and the AI by removing the ability for you to magically switch in a counter for every Pokémon the AI switches in after a fainting.

Some more interesting variations-

5) No Evolution- You can’t evolve your Pokémon period, pretty self explanatory. If you want to go even further, you must only catch unevolved first stage Pokemon that have the capability of evolving. For example, in the first rule set, catching a Graveler is okay as long as you don’t evolve it and catching a Stunfisk is fine even though it doesn’t evolve. In the second rule set, neither of these are legal.

6) No STAB- Disallowing STAB really changes the way you play the game, giving increases importance to Pokémon with good coverage and leveling the playing field for Pokémon with bad offensive types. In addition, the power loss due to not having STAB forces you to think more strategically.

7) Perma-Torment- Imagine if your Pokémon are under the torment status effect permanently and can never use the same move twice in a row. As a caveat, protect is banned because it kind of defeats the purpose.

8) Ultimate Underdog- Okay this one is just sadistic. As a brief footnote, I tried pairing this with a Nuzlocke and rules 1-4 in Sapphire and got up to Tate and Lisa before giving in. I definitely think I could’ve beat the game, but with gen 3s limited mechanics (no reusable TMs, nowhere for real easy grinding) the mode got tedious fast. Try this in Gens 5-7. Anyways, the gist of it is whenever your opponent sends out a Pokémon, if you have a Pokémon that is weak to one of its STAB types, you MUST immediately switch that Pokémon in. For example, if you have a Shroomish out and the opponent sends out a Electrike, you must bring out your Gyarados if you have one. But let’s say you also have a Taillow, you can choose to bring out either Taillow or Gyarados. Pokémon will drop FAST if you play this as a Nuzlocke using rules 2-4 and it will test your patience and strategy but I guarantee it’ll feel amazing when you complete it. As a slightly easier (I’d hesitate to call any of this easy) alternative, try ignoring the set battle rule. That way, when you send in your weak Pokémon you don’t always have to tank one hit upon switching it in.

NOTE: Allowing yourself to deposit Pokémon freely for the previous challenge will take away the entire purpose of it since you could always look up who the trainer you fight next has and then switch up your team so no one is weak to their STAB types. 

So that’s all I have for additional rule sets to build upon a Nuzlocke or similar run. But I also have another new game mode completely that I’d like to share.

(BONUS) Wild Pokémon Only- There’s only one rule here and it’s simple: if you’re Pokémon levels up, you can use it for the rest of the battle but never again use it. That’s it. Otherwise, you can do anything you like and can add any extra challenges as you want. Basically, the gist is you will end up relying on only the wild Pokémon in the area to win your battles and nothing else. 

There’s some really big pluses to this challenge. First it’s pretty replicable. Unlike a Nuzlocke, where two players will have vastly different Pokémon by the 3rd gym leader let’s say, here you can collaborate with others to find an optimal strategy to beat every major boss fight. In addition, as I’ve tried it, it makes gym battles feel like this giant puzzle to solve before you even step in the gym, and the gym battles are really worth it.

There’s also some downsides to this challenge. Prepare to have all your money drained in buying Pokeballs, and trainer battles get sort of tedious because you have to keep catching new Pokémon every time one of your old ones levels up. There’s also the fact that maybe this might not be possible in many games. In something like Ultra Moon where you can catch level 60s before the Elite Four then yes I can see it as possible. But think about the implications of fighting the Elite Four and champion. You basically can only use one Pokémon in each fight since leveling up makes them unusable in subsequent fights. Alternatively you can use more than one but you have to make sure the others don’t level up in the fight. I’m currently doing a run of this in Sapphire and the story seems possible to beat up til the Elite Four but I’m unsure from there. But again, the positive is the community can come together as a whole to strategize.

Anyways that’s it! Hopefully you enjoyed at least one of these ideas.",,9cclin,,0,,false,1540064508,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9cclin/some_interesting_new_challenge_run_rulesets/,,,false,Discussion,

I think that it would be pretty interesting if all gym leaders had maxed level pokemons (which is probably how it would be in a real pokemon universe) and what differentiated them was the type that they fought with or specialized in. The game would be built around you as a trainer having to get your act together to fight against them to begin with nad likely more story/questing would be required.

When people play Pokemon, they generally gravitate to a Pokemon type they like best and have a type they like least. But have you had your opinion about a type change because of a Pokemon you used in game? 

For instance, I was never much of a fan of Bug or Grass type Pokemon, but then I used a Volcarona in Pokemon Black, Leavanny in Pokemon Black 2, and Gogoat in Pokemon Y and now I appreciate the two types a lot more (and use more Pokemon of those types!)

Thanks for the wonderful moments.(LONG),"TLDR: Pokemon marathon has been such an amazing ride, and it's all because of Twitch chat. Makes the show 10x better. Go watch it now!!

I've been watching the Twitch marathon this whole week. I saw almost all the episodes. The movie just finished, so now I just want to recap on how amazing this stream has been with the chat.

I've never really used Twitch prior to this summer. Eventually I started watching Smash streamers like ZeRo and Nairo, and eventually started watching more iconic streamers like Greekgodx, Andy Milonakis, and of course Tyler1. I wasn't going to watch the Pokestream initially, but eventually I decided to give it a go. 

I haven't watched the Pokemon anime in years. I stopped around the release of the Black and White anime around 2012. But I still watched the original Indigo League episodes back when I a kid. Upon re-watch, I didn't even realize the jokes that I was too young to understand. But what stood out was watching it with 45 thousand people. 

Watching the marathon with chat was like watching it with a concert crowd. Constant spam, PogChamps and LUL's plastered on the wall of messages. It's so fun. Of course, there are memorable moments. The PogChamps when Charmeleon evolved into Charizard, the Jebaited's when Team Rocket tricked Ash and friends, the Kreygasm's when a mildly attractive girl showed up, and the KappaPride spam whenever James dressed up as a girl. But there were two amazing moments for me.

The first was when Ash released Butterfree, Primeape, and (almost) Pikachu. There was nothing but &lt;3 and BibleThumps. That would continue for the next 5 minutes. Made the release way more emotional. The other moment was whenever Team Rocket made their monologue and when the Main Theme played. Chat spammed copypasta of the monologue and the theme. It definitely hyped up what was yet to come.

I only type this because I think I'm done with the marathon. I only wanted to watch until the First Movie, which airs today. Classes start anyway so today is a good place to stop. I might watch a little bit of the Orange Islands, but nothing past that. It's been such a fun ride. If you aren't watching the stream, go watch it now. And to those who are going to watch the whole series, I hope you have as much fun as I did. :)",,9celgn,,0,,false,1540065416,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9celgn/the_pokemon_marathon_has_been_a_wild_ride_thanks/,,,false,Discussion,

First of all, sorry if this should've been posted in the Question Thread but I figured it's something bigger and something that's up for Discussion so I wanted to do it here.


I plan to play Pokemon Yellow soon, and with that I got a few questions:

Given that you can't get all 151 in a single game and there being a glitch to get them, similar to the Mew glitch, I've been wondering:

-Should I use said glitch to get all the missing ones like Meowth, the Rocket Pokémon, the other Fossils(won't have to worry about starters here) and so on?

-Should I use the Mew Glitch(that one is a separate thing from the above since you can't get that one from any G1 version anymore since that was apparently an event?)

-Should I completely skip out on that and just play it regularly, having a incomplete Pokédex in the end? :V

-Are there ways to edit the savefile without any addons or custom firmware required?

Not interested in modding my 3ds, once there's no more updates and stuff closes down I'll probably consider custom firmware and all, but not for now.
The idea is that I could play through the game regularly but wouldn't regret not having done the glitch as I'd still have a way to get the Pokémon unobtainable in said version if I really wanted to.


Further I have the question about the Legendary Birds which apparently appear only once:

What if I ""fail"" the encounter by getting knocked out or defeating them on accident, will I then be screwed out of getting them?
Any other good tips for it?


A few Infos:

I'm not entirely new, heck I had played some Pokémon games before but never finished:

Did try out yellow a long time ago, did get past the Mountain part but stopped shortly after.

Also tried out the remakes of Red and Blue/Green, think I got about 50% of the main game done on Leaf Green.
In both cases I did get a bit bored and kind of stopped playing, to never continue and all, kind of how I was as a kid since I did try many different things and all.

Recently was hunting for a WiiU and got one, which also included(Stylus missing though) a yellow 2ds which would of course be the Pokémon Yellow Edition, kind of ironic, given it was the first Pokémon game I looked at.

I don't mind the ""old graphics"" and all that stuff and am aware on how it's different to the later games, especially the recent generations and have actually been looking some things up(a bit worried on running out of money but I guess there's enough and saving before the Safari Zone is the best way to tackle that one?)",,9cfp00,,0,,false,1540065943,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9cfp00/new_player_thats_going_to_play_vc_yellow_and_has/,,,false,Discussion,
1535924824,pokemon,ChaosDragonI,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9cfu4a/a_more_realistic_world_of_pokémon/,14,0,,,A More Realistic World of Pokémon?,"Everyone knows that the anime and the games are made for kids, so there are a lot of things that aren't realistic. For example, why doesn't everyone just become a Pokémon trainer, why is there seemingly no crime, and why is the law enforcement (Officer Jenny), so inadequately equipped? If it were more realistic, there would be more crime and Jenny can't handle everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to brainstorm a Pokémon world where there are few to no holes.

&amp;#x200B;

 I propose a more realistic setting, in which there is a heavy emphasis on the military. Parents want their kids to grow up and get a job that pays. The military is the most respected and well paid job because combat is dangerous, and the gyms and the Pokémon League are used as part of the testing process to get into the military. A journey through a whole region beating gyms establishes independence, survival skills, and becoming physically fit. The military is not in complete control of everything however, otherwise that just creates a corrupt government where the powerful are in control of everything. A voting system is in place like the U.S. to vote people into higher positions of the military. The higher positions would have the representatives for the region, deciding what's best for the people. With democracy, people can have rights. If they don’t like someone in the military, they can be voted out of the military and have their Pokemon confiscated, possibly with probation to make sure they don't train new ones to become criminals. A Pokemon journey is dangerous, which is why not everyone would do it. This gives more incentive towards choosing different career paths.  

&amp;#x200B;

What are some flaws in my setting? What are some things I didn't address?  


I can think of one thing I didn't address, and that's the legendaries. If someone catches one, especially a powerful one such as Dialga who can manipulate time, that could disrupt the power balance and make them a dictator. Should catching legendaries be banned? Maybe if the military takes notice of someone trying to catch one they can send all their trainers out there to stop them.",,9cfu4a,,0,,false,1540066008,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9cfu4a/a_more_realistic_world_of_pokémon/,,,false,Discussion,

I think I have most of the tools needed to start a breeding project, at least in ultra moon because i completed that dex. I also have sun, alpha sapphire, x and black 2 but don't have a lot of great starting ground for breeding. 

I'm willing to take on a breeding project for someone who has an idea of something they want, but haven't gotten a chance to start it yet. Mostly because i have no idea what i want to breed for and am open to ideas. 

I don't hack so I don't have a 6iv ditto, but i have multiple 4ivs caught through SOS. I understand passing natures and IV's with items, but still haven't totally figured out egg moves. 

Currently I am breeding smeargle and castform by the box full. Castform has great trade value on the GTS and smeargle has so many uses now i felt like i needed a bunch. Lol

I'll be on for quite some time today and probably tomorrow so if anyone has any input I'll gladly take a look into it. I am willing to try a niche project like a specific shiny hunter, or something you would want to try and use competitively. Im up for any of it. 

Thanks!

1. Walking with Pokémon (highly requested)
2.HD graphics 
3. Mega evolutions are back in the spotlight
4. Catching wild Pokémon is a bit different
5. Same battle system
6. Online Battles


I don’t see any of these things as bad. I mean it’s just missing wild battles. Wild battles were starting to get relatively useless anyways, and most of the people who appear to be complaining are the people who Gen all their Pokémon in and play showdown all day.

so far I have a Mareep, cyndaquil and was thinking of trying to get geodude and maybe a gastly too

1536419002,pokemon,OnTheOriginOfPokemon,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9e4vwp/i_counted_the_most_common_physical_traits_in_gen/,69,642,,,I counted the most common physical traits in Gen 1 Pokémon and combined them to make the most Pokémony Pokémon possible,"I’ve been researching Gen 1 Pokémon and noticed that certain design features keep reoccurring. I thought it would interesting to work out which features are the most common and use the data to draw an ‘archetypal’ Gen 1 Pokémon.

[Here is the result](https://imgur.com/a/r33tLpn)

If you want to know more about why it looks the way it does I’ve explained each choice below.

The archetypal Gen 1 Pokémon would be poison type, or possibly poison/water. So, it's no surprise that the most common colours are blue followed by purple. Gen 1 Pokémon take lots of inspiration from Kaiju, giant monsters from the Japanese film genre of the same name. We see this with how common the bipedal stance is and how the Kaiju-like tail is the most common type of tail. Additionally, spikes/bumps are the most common aesthetic feature in Gen 1.

At this point I was concerned that the archetypal Pokémon was just a blue dinosaur, after all, Gen 1 Pokémon overwhelmingly lack ears and possess two simple nostrils. The most common eye type is an angry glare with dark irises. Adding some fangs and a light belly and you have a very average looking (boring) Pokémon. So I got a little creative with the spikes. I was inspired by a sea urchin due to its poison typing. Its only fair to include a concept since every Pokémon has one in its design! This isn’t perfect science but was fun to do, I love it when science and design cross paths!

If more Pokemon have a trait than don't have them I decided to include the trait and go with the most common style of that trait. I compiled some of the data below:

Rule: Don't go for easy pickings like splash. 

Rototiller- Raises the attack and special attack stat of all grounded grass type Pokemon.

On the surface this move doesn't seem that bad. It raises both attack stats! So why is this move bad? Simple the amount of Pokemon that can learn this move is shockingly low. Only 17 pokemon can learn this move and out of those 17 11 of them can learn it naturally. 

Another thing that makes this move terrible is that despite the fact that its a grass-type support move ironically enough the only grass type Pokemon that can learn it naturally is Tapu Bulu. All the others are either ground or normal type pokemon. 

Finally you are basically forced to use it in double battles and even then there's better options out there such as grassy terrain or other stat-boosting moves like bulk up or work up. Neither of which requires you to have only grass type Pokemon to get its effect off.

I am fully aware that it's likely not going to be an amazing Pokemon game, but I can look past all that just because it's Pokemon! And on the Switch nonetheless! Everyone needs to calm down about these games, this is NOT the direction the series is going towards more then likely. I'm fairly certain that the main purpose of these games is to bring in more players from Go. It's not trying to cater to all us other players.

We will get the games we want next year, just watch.

If you don't like LGPE, that's fine, but stop trying to ruin the fun for those who ARE excited to play it. We get it, you don't like it, show Game Freak by voting with your wallets, and stop yelling at us. You don't have to shove your reasons why it'll be not as fun in our faces. We know.

Right now I'm playing through [Ultra Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PN1Vnl6hJI) for the first time and recently got to see Charjabug's pokedex entries from the games and anime.

  
Charjabug, the Battery Pokémon. A Bug and Electric type, and the evolved form of Grubbin. Charjabug stores electricity and can share it with other Pokémon.  Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around. From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac. It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you'll get a shock! Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love the idea that until people started using it as a battery it had all this energy stored up and was trying to share it with nearby pokemon, which I'm sure aren't always electric or ground type. So unless a Charjabug was lucky enough to be giving something else that was compatible or grounded it's electricity, it might have been zapping flying and water pokemon out of the air and water. Just wandering around, a little friendly battery of death on the move.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Take away the ability to ask for Pokémon that are a certain level if it’s impossible to get that Pokémon at said level. I am sick of seeing stuff like “the Pokémon I am looking for is a level 1-10 Blastiose”. I’m fine if it’s about an event Pokémon but most of the time people are just being a troll


2:Asking for shiny Pokémon or certain natures/abilities. I would love more options to get hard Pokémon easier. It’s really hard to link trade for shinies these days and adding an option to do so in GTS can make it easier to trade shinies. Maybe even make it so if you hit the “I am looking for shinies” button you can also have a button that says “I am looking for any Pokémon”.  And being able to request natures removes that tedious grinding for abras or constant breeding for that right nature. Just request a Pokémon with the nature that’s in the egg group and ka-blam

3: Custom level selections. Explains it’s self

4: Allow us to check IVs natures abilities etc of Pokémon in GTS. 


I think these 4 things will greatly enhance  everyone’s GTS expirence. What other ideas do you have

The roommate is a chronic liar who constantly connives his way into winning. He's always the one who is the most knowledgeable about the game we are playing, which enables him to change the rules however he pleases. He was notoriously inconsistent whenever we played a game of Munchkin and throughout the brief period of time I've known him, he's lied about having a list of things- including a doctorate degree and a terminal illness. Basically, he needs to get taken down off of his high horse.

&amp;#x200B;

The team that his roommate is playing with is a Spiritomb, Starmie, Cradily, Wigglytuff, Metagross, and Chimchar. Here's a screenshot of his team.

However, given the fact that Poipole left Ash's team on the Sun and Moon anime, he has two slots left... what the fuck!!! 

2 Members left... who will he get?  Well, since this is a discussion, I am open for what your thoughts are. So here's mine.

&amp;#x200B;

1.) **Pikachu**: Damn rat... when will you ever hang up your gloves?! Either way, Electro Web is very interesting if you are able to stop airborne or Levitating users. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) **Rowlet** \--&gt; **Dartrix**\--&gt; **Decidueye**: Damnit... Hau is going to be introduced and has a Dartrix (smh). For the love of God, Ash, Rowlet is sparring lately and needs to evolve. If you are going to include Hau with a Decidueye later in the anime, let Ash have one as well so both can fight during the Pokemon League making it one badass fight between the two. It has been a known fact that Steel. Psychic, and Ghost have been the most superior types Ash has ever battle against (ahem... Bisharp (Steel) (Ash what is with you against Bisharp?)). To be fair, Ash needs to implement a new formula where he has one or all three of these typing's can help him go all the way (that will be another discussion, not this one). Decidueye is going to help him big time if he had that hidden ability Long Reach though I do wonder what Brave Bird would be like if it's the quills that is going to hit others? You have the best battling record for now, but please evolve so I don't know how much longer I will be able to hold onto my hopes and reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) **Torracat** \--&gt; **Incineroar**: Litten wanted to fight Incineroar, he got his match. Then, he lost, but he was able to evolve to Torracat. So the only time he will ever evolve again is if he fights against Kukui or the Masked Royal's Incineroar. That would fascinate many if he evolves just to have that chance to beat Incineroar. 

&amp;#x200B;

4.) **Lycanroc Duck Form** \--&gt; No explanation needed mate. Already a consistent Pokemon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the last two: I will mention two Pokemon he will get and the other two he should bring back(another one will be discussed in another discussion) 

&amp;#x200B;

5.) **Jangmo-o --&gt; Hakomo-o**: Now me and my brothers have researched and thought this clear. He will probably get a Jangmo-o because I believe it's time Ash brings in another pseudo legendary to the team. Who wouldn't want a jewelry based dragon that is able to cause a lot of problems to others plus have well balanced offensive/defensive stats? Though I do think that since Jangmo-o will be his last member late in the anime so our best option is just to evolve as a Hakomo-o. I am like you all where we want to see Kommo-o fight along side with Ash and finally get a taste of Clanging Scales but if he is going to get it late, we might not see it, though I could be wrong. If he does get it, I'd be impressed to see it but I don't want it evolve it super quick with less battling experience like Noibat (Ash you're an idiot, you should have put him in fights, though you know you would never succeed in overpowering a Dragon Rush). 

&amp;#x200B;

6.) 2 ways: **Wimpod** \--&gt; **Golisopod** or **Bruxish**: First Wimpod, remember the time Ash helped Wimpod when it got stuck from a crevice? Yeah, a couple of episodes later, it showed a Wimpod crawling through the beach and it turns out that it was the same Wimpod he rescued! Does this mean we will finally have another Sandile/Aipom like member in his team? Is he crawling all over Alola just to join with him? First of all, Golisopod is badass and an interesting member given the fact that Ash will need to learn how to prioritize and handle its ability Emergency Exit since it will automatically sub out and summon someone else at random (anime logic, not game) First Impression and Liquidation will be the key moves to ensure a win for Ash. 

Now for Bruxish, to be honest, Bruxish is very interesting when it comes to being a nasty biter like Sharpedo. Why Bruxish you may ask? Here's my answer, gfiven the fact that I am highly positive that Guzma will appear in the anime, he is going to have that Golisopod we all love and it will stir things up for Ash if that Wimpod is willing to reunite with him. Someone like Bruxish will help Ash, like Decidueye, he can have a new typing he has not had from all of his Pokemon. Heck, I would even be surprised if this fish can use its psychic powers to levitate from land, that will make it very interesting. Given the fact that it is sorta fragile (he has many so we get the idea), it is a good option to have a Pokemon like Bruxish to use its ability to emit its power from its protuberance, you can use it to use it as your advantage to wear down your opponents and then finish with any moves like Psychic Fangs, Aqua Jet,, or Crunch. Bruxish can also be a threat if its ability was Dazzling, would cause so much problem to those who have priority moves. I think this Pokemon can be a great Pokemon Ash would like if he wants to stop defensive tanks since its multiple entries pointed out eating Shellders and Mareanies. Damn...     

&amp;#x200B;

Who should he bring back: 

&amp;#x200B;

5 and 6.) **Scraggy** \--&gt; **Scrafty** and **Corphish** \--&gt; **Crawdaunt**:  First of all, I know I did not mention Infernape, Sceptile, or Heracross, but let's look at the facts. One is that these two are ready to evolve. Another is that in Hoenn,Corphish was always disappointed when he got to see Ash's other Pokemon evolve while he trains extra hard to evolve and Scraggy wanting to evolve to show worth to Ash. If you had a Scrafty and Crawdaunt, how great would that be? One who is able to tank a lot of hits and fights very well as well as a boost with Moxie, Scrafty can be a vital member of his team if he wants to fight against Gladion (Dark-types). Scrafty may be a late edition of his team but we could see something like this just like Cyndaquil evolving to Quilava. Crawduant, I love Crawdaunt, he should bring in Corphish so he can get his dream come true to evolve and become a member of Ash's Alolan team. It can fill in the absence of a water type and I would love it to see this happening since his return to Kanto didn't make much of an effect showing a brief cameo of him. I really want Corphish to return and evolve. Could be the next Kingler to see how much he has grown and get him s couple of wins.

A story of love, growth, discovery, and Pokebank shenanigans.","TLDR: I've been playing ORAS with the love of my life, and she absolutely destroyed me, and I love that Pokemon constantly surprises us and brings us closer together in unusual ways!

Cut to about two months ago. My fiance tells me she wants to play Pokemon. Reduces stress, something to do during the commute, etc. Okay, I've got a blank copy of Alpha Sapphire and a semi complete copy of Omega Ruby. I get this funny idea, partially inspired by the rival Brendan/May of the ORAS series. 

The rival constantly checks your privilege. 

""Oh, you just beat so and so? Nice, take a look at my Grovyle!"" Proceeds to kick your butt with Leaf Blade, eight miles from the nearest Pokemon Center. They forced you to grind for a bit. They forced you to innovate, to predict what would come next. Then by the end of the campaign, your rival is something of a friend, someone who's watched you grow this entire time, and that struck home for me when I first played it. I decided to be Brendan to my fiance's May. 

First battle goes about the way you'd expect. I chose Mudkip, she chose Torchic. 

I brought Poochyena, she brought Lotad. I swept. 

Keep in mind, I've played these games since I could talk. Since I could poop on my own. Pokemon is a way of life. To her it was stress relief. 

The next fight is a little tougher, after some coaching, some analysis and hint dropping. Suddenly, Mightyena can't keep up with Combusken. Suddenly Shroomish isn't keeping pace with Lombre. Suddenly Marshtomp is getting clobbered by Kirlia! 

What do I do? I can't let her get ahead of me!

I invest. I move over a level one Larvesta for my fire type. A level one Bagon for my dragon. I catch an Aron. I dump Mightyena in favor of Absol, grinding outside Fortree for one with Megahorn. 

And I win. Totally blindsided her, winning in a 5-0. Triumphant, filled with pride, I look at her and she just smiles at me. 

""Good job."" 

Oh... I just messed up... I really messed up. I took away the thrill. I jumped myself ahead just to get a *win*. All this time, after six badges and hard won victories against Norman, Flannery, Archie, she just wanted to keep up with me. And I cheated. 

I slowed down. I took my time. I gathered items I knew I didn't need. We walked through Shoal Cave together, we fought Groudon/Kyogre together. I knocked Groudon out cold, but she took her time with Kyogre, and I knew it. What did I care, I had Volc and Salamence by then! 

The final battle approached. I transferred over one more that I knew I would need, at this point realizing that my Mence was too OP. 

She texted me the next day. 

""I beat him. I beat Steven."" 

I replied with a GIF of Raffiki, ""It is time!"" 

Final battle territory, 6v6, Single Battle rules, everyone's set to level 50. 

Breloom goes out, and Mega Blaziken counters. I switch to Swampert. She slams me with a blaze kick to the face. I can take it. Go Mega Swampert, and Latias comes in. Friggin Latias!!! 

Of course I failed the predict and used EQ, to which she responds with a Draco Meteor from hell itself, bringing Swamp to 34 HP. Latias Flies, Aggron switches in. Latias runs, and Blaze comes back in. After a cheeky predict, I thought Aggron could take Blaze after an Autotomize. 

He couldn't. 

One after another, our Pokemon countered each other, switching in and out, back and forth, until at last, at the end of our ropes, Blaziken came in and wiped my Breloom. All I had left was Swampert, the poor thing. Two Megas, our starters, our longtime friends and companions, duking it out one last time. 

Blaziken took me down with Sky Uppercut. 

This all happened minutes ago, so forgive the dripping sap from this post, but I just can't help but feel nostalgic. 

Throughout the years, we've seen rivals, gym leaders, Totem Pokemon jumping ahead with artificial levels, fake movesets, unearned buffs, crit hax and all sorts of bull. 

I transferred over the most powerful Pokemon I could think of. And my fiance destroyed me. 3-0. Raikou, Volcarona, Mega Swampert in rain, Super Luck Absol, none of them stood a chance. And maybe after 20-something years of playing this game, I've grown complacent. Maybe after seeing her slow crawl through what I thought was a simple campaign, I thought nothing could stand in my way. I would show her. I could keep being that Pokemon Master. 

I've never been so glad to be so wrong. 

Maybe after 20 years of playing this game, keeping it to myself, I've come to think of myself as the expert. Maybe after every defeat, we begin to learn something about ourselves as Trainers. Maybe after 5 years of loving this beautiful woman, I'm awestruck that she brought to bear her willpower and genius that I've envied for so long, and absolutely put me in my place. What I love about this game, and what I think she's come to love about it too, is how often it can surprise us. How often we can be so sure of ourselves, and lose. And how every loss comes with the knowledge that the person before us, the person who looks at you with a big shit eating grin on their face when your Swampert goes down to Mega Blaziken, is someone who gave their all, who devoted their time and energy to their friends. Their team. To this game, probably more than you did, even with the benefit of PokeBank and EV training. 

Seriously, how the hell did she beat me? 

At the end of the day, and it's about midnight here, the time you put into your team, the effort you put into training them... It doesn't come close to the love you feel for that person who beat you. You want to know them. You want to know why, and how, and maybe that's scary, but you know that you have a long way to go. And after beating me, she held out her DS and said, ""More! Plug in another!"" 

""Another, what?"" 

""Another game! I want to play another one!"" 

That's probably the best feeling of all. That the adventure isn't over yet. 

Please congratulate u/thesparkawingdiamond for becoming a true Pokemon Master.

So, this is mostly my opinion, but as a Pokémon fan of about sixteen years, I’d say that this game series is very important to me. And with Heartgold/Soulsilver as my current favorite, I think you’ll know why I chose specific things to be in future Pokémon titles. Please don’t be judgmental, as these ideas were also brought up from many Pokémon YouTubers.

My first idea is: The next title’s name. Pokémon Prism or Pokémon Rainbow..? Alt version: Pokemon Monochrome. Of course, I shouldn’t guess, but I think it’d be interesting if those were the next main games’ titles.

My second idea: The ability to visit other regions and battle gym leaders for leveling or nostalgia purposes. (Also for grinding and getting specific Pokémon.) What if new discoveries have been made in the other regions? What if the gym leaders are new there, or they’re older now? If so, what would they look like? The creepy and mysterious places that we never found out about like the Mansion with the butler and little girl. Did it change? So many questions I’d love to have answered with that possibility!

My third idea: More options to raise friendliness with Pokémon, examples would be playing with, feeding different foods, and letting them out of their pokeball to walk with you. I, of course, know that this will probably be implemented into the new series’ as seen from X/Y, ORAS, and Sun/Moon, but why tease us with markets in Sun by showing the actual names of things and prices, without the ability to buy?

-Slightly higher age range, 16+ rather than just the same 10 year old age. Much like Pokémon Coliseum. Since all fans grow up, and people in general, I believe that there should be some game that’s deticated to older fans rather than consistently being dedicated to children. I have no problem with it, however I’d rather be seen as a young adult like I am now rather than a child.

But like I said, those are just my thoughts as another fan of Pokémon. Thanks for reading!",,9fyxzx,,0,,false,1540125384,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9fyxzx/pokémon_hopes_and_dreams_for_future_titles/,,,false,Discussion,

I am not subverting Pikachu which is still Pokémon’s main mascot at large, but when laser focusing on a specific aspect of Pokémon there might be a better mascot.

Some examples I can think of:

* Pokémon TCG - Holographic Charizard, from the fabled base set holographic Charizard card.
* Pokémon VGC - Pachirisu, from Sejun Park’s 2014 master rank champion team.
* Individual (core series) games - the Pokémon on its cover (Blastoise = Pokémon Blue, Eevee = Pokémon Let’s Go! Eevee, etc)
* Individual Regions - legendary trios together (Weather Trio = Hoenn, Light Trio = Alola, etc.)

Some other at-large ideas I have:

* Pokémon battles at large - Mudkip, from a (pretty epic) Chinese Showdown battle where gty’s Yawn-Protect-Surf Mudkip managed to win against an Empoleon, already the mascot of Pokémon battles at large here.
* Pokémon memes at large - Mudkip again, from the “I herd you liek Mudkipz” meme.
* Pokémon shipping at large - Gardevoir &amp; Gallade, specifically Rara and Kirly from Pokémon Adventures trained by Ruby and Sapphire respectively.
* Pokémon music at large - Jigglypuff, specifically the Jigglypuff with microphone from the anime.",,9fzjne,,0,,false,1540125680,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,1-3 smtrainerflair tf-sm28 tf tf1,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9fzjne/idea_give_every_aspect_of_pokémon_a_separate/,,pokemon.trade(with: me),false,Discussion,

The first is to find a way to allow the game to progress at a pace that does not make you OP by the 3rd region. My idea would be that once the first main region is complete, all other matches with gym leaders, elite four, etc. are capped like online battles. This way, the progression is not about levelling up but improving stats. This can also act as an introduction to competitive training for those of us who want to get into it but had no reason to. 
This idea does not fix any issues with story pacing, but that may be fixed with the next idea.

A lot of players like the idea of an all region game for the exploration and the freedom rather than anything else. Therefore, let this game not follow the main pokemon formula, where battling is still there, but not linear and even optional. There will be no big storyline, just small tidbits for world building. This does not need to be a mainline game, even a side game would be nice. The idea is just to give players the experience of actually living in the pokemon world and nothing else.

I watched the TV series religiously as a child, but I've only played Leaf Green (beat the E4 once), White (finished the story), Y (900 hours or so), and most of Omega Ruby (up to getting Primal Groudon). I'm planning to change that soon.

I'm planning on buying one of each Pokémon generation, and playing through them all. I'm planning to go Red, then Gold, then Ruby, then Pearl, then Black, then Black 2, then X, then Sun, then Ultra Sun. After that I'd likely play the remakes (HG, FR, AS, and LGP when it comes out), and maybe the third versions (Yellow, Crystal, Emrald, Platinum). I hope to finish in time for the 2019 Pokémon release on the Switch.

Is it worth playing both the ""main"" version and then the third version, or should I just replace the first with the third (e.g. Crystal instead of Gold)?

Is there any reason I should play the games out of order? I'm a little concerned about jumping into the first release, with no ""quality of life"" updates, right off the get-go, but I feel like slowly descending into it (going last to first) would be worse.

I’m new to Pokemon, and I just today started playing Pokémon Blue on an emulator. I just fought against Brock, with a level 6 Metapod, a level 10 Pidgey (that I never used), a level 6 Rattata (which fainted), a level 5 Pikachu (which fainted, and also dealt no damage at all because apparently Thundershock doesn’t affect rock types or something), a level 12 Bulbasaur, and a level 5 Caterpie (which also fainted). My main battle plan is to get off a Leech Seed and then switch to a low level Pokémon so it can get experience. The first fight was with Geodude, which wasn't very noteworthy. Pikachu and Caterpie both fainted, and Metapod was knocked down to 2 hp but leveled up to 7. Then a level 14 Onix came out, and I remember this because Metapod was out and was half of his level. I sent out my Bulbasaur, got the Leech Seed out, and then sent back out Metapod. At this point, and up until Brock told me, I had no idea what Bide did. As it turns out, all his Onix knew, or ever used, was Bide, and another move that didn’t do damage. Because it was a Metapod, all I could use was Harden, so I did. I thought  must have been super lucky to have “Bide” miss all three times he used it, but what I didn’t know, and what you may not know, is that Bide, according to Brock, adds up all damage incurred while it’s charging and inflicts it double. However, since my Metapod wasn’t doing damage with Harden, and I guess since the Bulbasaur that was Leech Seeding the Onix wasn’t out, the Bide wasn’t “hitting”. The only thing my Bulbasaur ever did in the fight was use Leech Seed, and it still managed to cause the Onix to faint, and so I won with a Metapod, who by the way, ended the match with max hp from the Leech Seed, and leveled up again to 8. I also ended up teaching the awarded TM34 (Bide) to Rattata.

Edit 1: The Metapod was the last Pokémon I had left once again, and I managed to have used Harden so much that I unlocked Struggle and I ended up defeating another Pokémon several levels higher than it.

Edit 2: In Vermilion City, in the fight with the Team Rocket goon in the guy’s backyard, I started at a slight disadvantage because I hadn’t healed all Pokémon because I didn’t know he was a bad guy, most Pokémon were fine, and I figured that there’d be another Pokémon Center before I get to the SS Anne. My Level 17 Pikachu was at a little over half health. My full loadout was a Level 24 Ivysaur, the Level 17 Pikachu, a Level 11 Butterfree (the evolution of that very Metapod), a Level 8 Rattata with 1 PP UP used, a Level 16 Pidgey, and a Level 9 Metapod (evolved from Caterpie, don’t use anymore). Anyway, this guy pulls out a Level 17 Machop, which wasn’t any trouble. My Ivysaur leveled up to 25 in the fight. Then he pulls out a Level 21 Drowzee that knows Confusion and Disable (it also knew Hypnosis but it failed the one time he tried to use it). He almost faints my Ivysaur and confuses it, faints my Pidgey, almost faints the Rattata, and almost faints the Metapod. It then came down to my Level 11 Butterfree... that only knows Harden. In the vain hope that I end up finding an out, I did. The Drowzee used Disable and disabled Harden. Thus, I now had access to Struggle, and I took the Level 21 Drowzee down with the Level 11 
Butterfree.

Edit 3: I beat a Drowzee with a Fearow that had just learned Mirror Move. The Drowzee used Disable to disable Rest, which was a bit annoying, so I used Mirror Move to Disable him, but it ended up disabling his Disable. Then I wrecked it.

Edit 4: In Silph Co., in the battle with my rival (which I named Stank), all the levels of his Pokémon added together was greater than mine. It was down to my Level 46 Venusaur and a Level 20 Magikarp (was 19 before the battle started) and Stank had his Level 40 Charizard. I only managed to get one Razor Leaf and two Cuts off on it before Venusaur fainted (Leech Seed was out of PP). The only Pokémon I had left was the Magikarp. I used Tackle in the vain hope that I could kill it. He used Leer. I used Tackle. He used Leer. I used Tackle one last time and fainted the Charizard. It turned out that, because my Magikarp was a water type, Stank wouldn’t use any fire type moves against it, even though he still could have defeated me if he hadn’t.

Edit 5: I was using a Fearow that knew Mirror Move and I wrecked Meowth with Pay Day after he missed with it.

Edit 6: I was using my Pidgeotto that I taught Fly, and twice I used fly against Voltorb and Electrode respectively. In that turn that I was in the flying stage, both enemy Pokémon selfdestructed so I won without doing any damage.",,9g40av,,0,,false,1540127749,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9g40av/beat_brock_in_pokémon_blue_2v6/,,,false,Discussion,

1537044272,pokemon,precita,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9g4tc8/with_the_sm_cameos_misty_is_in_nearly_290/,16,103,,,"With the SM cameos, Misty is in nearly 290 episodes of the anime","The OS with Kanto/Johto combined was 276 episodes long, but Misty wasn't in the very last episode so she's in 275 episodes.

She then cameo'd in 4 full episodes in AG. She also got 4 special episodes, then that Mastermind special. For intents and purposes this is 285 episodes if you count the specials.

The first SM cameo was a 2-parter, so that's 287 episodes.

The second SM cameo could be anywhere from 2-4 eps or so, so she'll definitely hit 290 episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this may seem like a lot, but then you realize Ash/TR are in over 1000+ eps of the anime, and Brock was in around 600+ episodes of the anime. Misty is still the shortest lived classic Kanto character of the series, for obvious reasons that Brock continued into Hoenn and DP while she didn't.

But she's still in the most eps of all the female leads, for obvious reasons that all the other girls leave after their gen ends and don't get as many cameos. May and Dawn were the next longest lasting companions at nearly 200 episodes if you count their cameos. All the other girls much less because they're only around 3 years.

Doesn't really matter though, but it's interesting to think about.

1537053768,pokemon,alefsousa017,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9g5yjc/unused_eeveelutions_possible_stats/,21,27,,,Unused Eeveelutions possible stats,"So, with the new games about to drop and the possibility (and hopes) for a new eeveelution to show up, I threw together a table showing up what I think would the possible stats be for each of the types that were not still used for Eevee's evolutions . 

I actually used the types stats from this imgur post ([https://imgur.com/gallery/7wAPO](https://imgur.com/gallery/7wAPO), all credits to u/AeroTheManiac for the images and reddit post) to determine the stats distribution for each of the types still unused, with the template of the current eeveelutions we have, meaning, based on this post's stats distribution, which stat would be 130 base, which stat would be a 110 base and so on, and this is what I came up with!  
Also, for the Normal type evolution, I actually just took Eevee's base stats and gave them a boost, so that the normal type evolution would still have the same 525 base stat total of every other evolution while still maintaining a ""unique"" feel to it so that it may be viable for some use, I don't know..

&amp;#x200B;

[Unused eeveelution stats](https://i.redd.it/hejm6vh0ihm11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for comparison and easy of view, these are the stats of the current eeveelutions we have:

[Actual eeveelution stats](https://i.redd.it/46utk146ihm11.png)

What is actually really nice to see is that no eeveelution have the same base stats distribution of another, real or not, meaning each and everyone of those would really be unique and be able to bring something new to the table!  
Just by looking at it fast, I can see that a fighting type Eeveelution would be a beast for an all out physical attacker with some bulk to take a hit or too with that 95 HP stat. The ghost type one I also find really interesting! This goes to show that most eeveelutions would be really good offensively, mainly on the physical side of things.  
Also, keep in mind that the source I used didn't have the gen 7 Pokémon yet, but I don't think the overall overcome would change so much with the addition of the gen 7 Pokémon.  


I'd like to know what you all think about it, what would be the changes you would make to some of these types, possible abilities and uses for competitive or casual and such!

Well, tbh, it is boring for me now, but I used to be obsessed with it. I really think that the Pokemon Center is too less, much more has to happen. I can’t explain all, but here’s what I generally think about it. It’s basically the same as real life veterinary medicine, with a few tweaks.

* Some Pokemon have more knowledge about their medical care than others. Sadly, this means that only a few Pokemon would be able to get organ transplants, maybe your sick starter can but not pseudo-legends.
* Some Pokemon are more prone to health problems than others.
* Most Pokemon need vaccines, there’s a Pokerus vaccine available to help keep Pokemon modest ~~not the nature~~ and less overpowered.
* Most organs found in the human/dog/cat/vertebrate body are found in most Pokemon, yes even bug types (I've said this before) and inanimates, but ghost types typically don’t have them. Of course, the anatomy of a Pokemon is highly dependent on what animal it is based off, such as bird Pokemon having air sacs.
* There are specialists for each type of Pokemon, like vets specializing in one or more species, doctors for all Pokemon are rare. Nurse Joy seems so unrealistic to me, oof.
* Pokemon usually get their medical care at Pokemon Centers, but there are some doctors found on routes.
* All Pokemon need to get a wellness exam every year, more so for just-hatched Pokemon. But, seeing how often some Pokemon are used for battling, they probably would go much more often.
* All Pokemon can get specific diseases and parasites, yep even most of them can get parasitic worms. Some diseases can affect multiple types of Pokemon, like electric discharge affecting electric types. Pokemon should be able to get the same diseases their real-world counterparts could get, because I also think real-world animals do exist in Pokemon, maybe the diseases could spread from animals to Pokemon.
* There’s no medicine that can work on ALL Pokemon, a lot of medicines may do benefit to one Pokemon while severely weakening the others. Every Pokemon has its different metabolism. The potions in game make no sense.
* Most Pokemon can get blood tests (the blood tests can show their blood count and if they’re anemic or not, their liver/kidney/heart health, if they have resistance to a disease, or if they’re deficient in nutrients), urine tests, stool tests (yes, ew, to check for diarrhea or parasites), biopsies, and all other sorts of tests; some Pokemon probably need these tests once a year but I still don’t know which ones.
* X-ray machines in the Pokemon world are unique. Since the sizes of Pokemon range from Joltik to Mudsdale, there are probably different x-ray machine sizes, I can see 2 maybe one for Pokemon up to 200 lbs and the other for Pokemon 200 lbs+. Steel types need x-rays too, x-rays in the real world don’t pass through steel, but in the Pokemon universe there probably is an x-ray machine that can even pass through steel and show the innards of steel types easily. I would however think, stethoscopes wouldn’t be too differing in size. Maybe a CT scanner for all the Pokemon too.
* Surgery can be done on any Pokemon, like spaying and neutering them so they don't breed so quickly. And Spoink needs a pacemaker to keep its heart beating.
* Pokemon die like every other creature, and when a Pokemon dies, a necropsy can be performed to determine the cause of death. I guess almost every Pokemon species (probably not the ghost types or some extraterrestrials) has been necropsied, so each Pokemon group has its own protocol.
* Basically everything medical that exists for animals and even humans in the real world can be for Pokemon too.",,9g6cta,,0,,false,1540128854,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9g6cta/the_field_of_pokemon_medicine/,,,false,Discussion,

This may seem like a dumb topic, but I just thought I could discuss it with anyone interested...

Quick background....I grew up playing the generation 1 Pokemon games (R/B/Y) and played the TCG as well. All I knew was the original 151 pokemon and that's still all I really know.

I've got the hankering to play a new Pokemon game, but I'm reluctant to do so because I feel like I'm too ""out of the loop"" now. So much time has passed, so many new Pokemon have been created, and so many games released, that I feel like it wouldn't be a fun experience.

15 years ago, when I was playing the original games, I knew all of the Pokemon and I was comfortable with them. I knew which Pokemon to seek out and which were the good and bad ones to build my team around. Now? I have absolutely no idea about anything past #151. I kept putting off playing any other games after Yellow (well, technically Leaf Green/Fire Red) because I didn't feel like learning about all of the new stuff.

I'd like to sit down with my Game Boy and starting something new, but I'm having trouble moving out of my comfort zone of Gen 1 and I'm almost debating starting a new game in Fire Red instead of moving on to an entirely new generation of the Pokemon world.

Any thoughts? Am I totally missing out on some sort of greatness that exists after Gen 1? If I do move on, any game recommendations? Maybe just move to Gen 2?

Thanks all.

Has anyone else had this happen?,"So last October I hatched a shiny duskull. I wanted to evolve it and eventually get dusknoir but I only have one 3ds. I ended up depositing it in the GTS and requesting a very specific mythical Pokémon I had in my omega ruby game. (Duskull was on Alpha Sapphire) I traded for it in my OR game and everything went smoothly. I had my shiny dusknoir and I traded it up to the newest gen. Well I haven’t played my alpha sapphire game since then, and today I had the day to myself and decided to do some shiny hunting on it. 

I opened up the GTS to hopefully find a Pokémon that could learn false swipe and was a higher level (my file sucked cause I traded everything up, but I didn’t wanna start a new file bc shiny charm) and it immediately said the Pokémon I deposited came back. It gave me back my unevolved shiny dusclops, and I have the shiny dusknoir in my ultra sun game.

1537101544,pokemon,Midnight_Burn,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9ga8rc/argument_why_team_galactic_is_a_great_villain_team/,24,34,,,Argument: Why Team Galactic is a great villain team,"Recently, I've seen Team Galactic get quite a lot of heat in villain team discussions, especially since the last year or so (for some reason). They aren't quite as criticized as Team Aqua/Magma in RSE or Team Flare (which is for another topic), but whenever people aren't criticizing either of those teams, Team Galactic is almost always the one that gets the brunt of it, especially the grunts. There really aren't that many people defending them, so I feel the need to do so, especially since a lot of the hate towards them is unwarranted imo (even if I understand where most of the criticisms come from).

There's no doubt that the grunts are the most criticized part of Team Galactic. Bowl cuts and spacesuits aside, probably the most common complaint pitted against them is that they're ""dumb"" and ""impossible to take seriously"". People usually see this as a sign of lazy characterization/writing, hence they criticize them for this. I don't disagree with the fact that they're ""dumb"", but I do disagree that that's necessarily a sign of lazy writing. The reason why is because their portrayal suits the overarching theme of Cyrus's character perfectly. There's a part in the post game, where Saturn says: ""Cyrus hated the very idea of spirit. He hated spirit for being incomplete. And yet, using fiery exhortations, he rallied the spirit of others. What he hated most, he used to control others. Isn't that ironic?"" This line describes perfectly the dynamic between Cyrus and his grunts as seen back in their HQ. Just after he's succeeded in manipulating his grunts emotionally with his speech, Cyrus tells you that they aren't worthy of being in his new world because they are ""uniformly useless and incomplete"". Do you see where I'm going with this? The way Cyrus views them matches the way they're portrayed throughout the game: as people who are easily tricked, manipulated and are pretty much ""useless"". In other words, they're portrayed as ""dumb"" for a reason. What Cyrus doesn't realize is that they are actual people; actual people who helped him make his goal a reality despite their antics.

Another common complaint against the grunts is that their actions throughout the game don't make sense. I really don't see how this is the case. There are two instances here that people usually complain about: the part where they tried to steal Rowan's research regarding Pokémon evolution, and especially the part where they tried to steal honey. The first instance made sense, because Rowan tells you *immediately* after that that Pokémon release a mysterious energy during evolution, and we later learn that Team Galactic is a very energy-reliant organization. Hence, it makes sense that they'd be interested in any possible energy source they can find. The second instance also makes sense, because the grunts mention explicitly that they were doing so to attract large amounts of Pokémon for their organization's use. Is this the most effective way of gathering wild Pokémon? Debatable, but at least their actions here are relevant to their plan.

Moving on from the grunts, we then have the commanders. Honestly, I don't really see them talked about much, but there's something I want to mention here that I don't see around often. I really liked how they each had their own reasons for joining Team Galactic, their own perceptions of their leader, and their own paths after they've disbanded, even if the game doesn't make these super obvious. From her dialogue, Mars seems to believe that they were truly doing good (as shown by her quote in Valley Windworks: ""We've been trying to create a new world better than this one""), hence her reason for joining. Saturn joined out of fascination towards Cyrus's goal - ""I wanted to see what he would do. And I did."" It's implied in Stark Mountain that Jupiter doesn't really have a reason for joining other than ""fun"", hence she just leaves wandering off after their disbandment. Mars, on the other hand, goes off to look for Cyrus, while Saturn decides to reform Team Galactic on his own.

We now move on to the most important character of Team Galactic - Cyrus. There's no doubt he receives the most praise out of everyone in Team Galactic, what with people calling him threatening and a ""nutcase"" (which I don't exactly see as a compliment towards a character, but that's beside the point). However, not even he is immune to the criticism this team gets. Probably the biggest complaint against him is people going: ""What? So just because he hates spirit, he's going to destroy the whole world and everyone in it?"" And then they write this off as bad or lazy writing. Again, I disagree with this (even though I understand this complaint more than the other ones). The problem with this complaint is that it doesn't consider the lore which the game uses as its world-building. If you look outside the context of the game's world,  of course his goal is going to sound ridiculous. If you look at it within the context of the game, however, you'll notice that his goal matches perfectly with the lore and purpose of the legendaries. The main lore of the game is that the Lake Trio -beings of spirit- keeps balance with Dialga/Palkia -beings of time/space. If this connection between the Lake Trio and Dialga/Palkia seem too ""convenient"" for you, the relationship between spirit and time/space is elaborated on several times in the game; through relics such as Celestic's paintings (""Space is ever-expanding dimensions... Our spirits too, are as space..."") and Eterna's statue (""In laughter, there is tears, and likewise, it is with time""), and even Celestic's elder's and other npc's dialogues (""The time and space of Sinnoh are filled with the thoughts and memories of countless people and Pokémon""). This is where Cyrus fits into the story, because his hatred towards spirit conflicts with the locals' satisfaction with it. Cyrus's view of spirit is best summarized by his line near the start of the game: ""Had only time flowed and space expanded, there would've been no strife. Because the human spirit is incomplete, strife has spread."" See the parallelism between the legendaries and his motive here? The Lake Trio symbolizes the spirit he wants to get rid off, while Dialga and Palkia symbolize the time and space he wants his world to consist of solely. Furthermore, there's a reason why the Red Chain, used to control Dialga/Palkia, was made out of the Lake Trio *specifically*. This whole act is meant to symbolize Cyrus's hatred of spirit, and yet his simultaneous reliance on it to control others (the deities he had targeted since day one, in this case). The point here is that the writing around Cyrus isn't lazy, but purposeful as his goal, along with the whole general theme of his character, is tied around the main lore and world-building of the game.

So yeah, that's pretty much it. I know another common complaint is Cyrus's backstory, but that's a very subjective part of his character - some people find it flimsy, while others find it sympathetic. In this post, I'm mainly defending Team Galactic on the basis of their involvement and how well they fit into the story. In other words, I'm explaining why they are effective -and hence, great- as a villain Team.

1537133520,pokemon,NEEEEEEEEEEERD,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9gedus/deleting_your_first_save_file/,7,4,,,Deleting your first save file,"According to the date on my Starter pokemon, I first got Pokemon White on 3/8/11. This was my first Pokemon game.

When I started up the game today, I was interested in emptying out White Forest to try and isolate a single trainer in the forest for wild encounter purposes. (Particularly, the trainer with Ralts.) I hadn't opened this in years, and man, memories flooded back when I did.

Sadly, it's a lot of negatives. Tons of cheated Pokemon and even more cheated items. It's a little painful to look back on, especially since I'm an ultra purist nowadays.

Worse, I'm having trouble working with White Forest. I don't think I can empty it out.

However... I'm still struggling with the decision. It might not be quite like starting out from Pallet Town in the 90's with your Charmander, but this game was still pretty damn special to me. Taking my first steps onto Route 101 and catching tons of Lillipups, battling Team Plasma and entering the castle at the Pokemon League, even journeying to Liberty Garden and buying my first Ultra Balls to catch Victini... It's still somehow quite vivid. And when I look back on the awful nicknames that I came up with 7 years ago, I can't help but smile.

I've already changed the name of my Emboar to The First, to show he was my first Pokemon, and traded away both him and the Zekrom that N gave me to a different file. Now, I think all that's left is to start over.

Have any of you had to restart your first file for any reason? And do you have some last-minute recommendations to me before I bite the bullet?

There has been a lot of talk about shinies and how it will work in the game with no good answer. There is a japanese YouTube channel going by the name ""brother4 channel"", they got to try the game out early and in their demo play there was a shiny Weedle in the wild (picture is a screen grab from video). So all the talk about not being sure if the pokemon are shiny in the overworld/wild was answered 2 weeks ago when the video was uploaded. I do expect some people must have seen the video by now, but because there has not been any proper article (as of what I have seen) talking about the video I thought I would post it here for people to see. [Link to video and start at 3:40 where the shiny will be seen.](https://youtu.be/k203YlIR7eo?t=220) The shiny is on screen for 6 seconds before they encounter a non shiny pokemon. Hope this post helps a little bit for those that did not know.

Which of the two Alolan Legendary Pokemon do you think fit Nebby the most, storewise and/or appearance wise?

Personally I associate Nebby more with Lunala since the space-like body of Cosmoem looks more visible on Lunala, plus Cosmoem's body structure looks more similar to Lunala's than Solgaleo's.

so, I'm planning on completing the Pokedex in X without the help from Bank + Gen 7.. is it even possible?

Share, but I think that the weight of important battles means more to the average player than the difficulty. A crowd that reacts to super effective hits, critical hits, misses, or faints would be a perfect example.

 yet their solution for extra content is just so awful, i rather wish they just use dlc.

Like making every mythical under a code that can only be obtain at a super specific retail chain, that if anybody who live in a third world country has no access too at all, also put in a limited time

Because god forbid i can just download the pokemon in eshop like a normal game would do.

Oh yeah because of that, mythical pokemon cannot be used for tournaments eventhough they are practically design for it, and they can only be used after the whole chunk of the game is done, basically making them worthless trophies.

Other than that, instead of doing the latter, why not hostage a rare pokemon inside toys instead,  making mew trap inside a 50 dollar pay wall, all for a toy for that literally only work on two games. 

The literal other reason why pokemon won't do dlc, and here they are doing exactly that, just without the actual dlc part.

Or the fact they just love to screw over early adopters by making people who bought vanilla sun and moon, to gauge another full retail price if they want more content, by making the rehash full price only.",,9c1jdb,,0,,false,1540059043,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9c1jdb/am_i_the_only_who_think_gamefreaks_anti_dlc/,,,false,Discussion,

Being the second highest selling pokemon game, having such amazing music that even Sun and Moon still use some of it (hi Cynthia), and being the first Pokemon game that I've ever played are some of the things that stick with me. However, even in my 5 year old mind, there was a big loose end, and that is Cyrus. I didn't get why I never saw him again. Galactic as a team is the worst pokemon villain team there is, without question. Ugly haircuts, stupid plans, and of course, a level 16 Purugly.

Improving the impact of Team Galactic on the game:

For starters, I feel like each commander has a star pokemon that's threatening to players. Purugly with Fake Out, Skuntank with Night Slashes, and Saturn with his Toxicroak's raw attack power make for scary commanders in battle. However, thematically, not so much. I feel like their personalities could be delved into a little deeper. Personally I think of Mars as the stereotypical airhead, who doesn't put much thought into what she does, Jupiter as a bitter person who couldn't find a proper job in the Jubilife City Store (maybe she's Fantina's unintentional sister or something, and got shoved out of Gym Leader by her), and Saturn as that determined intern who'll become a master of all sorts of corporations and be the businessman that Cyrus is only pretending to be, as soon as he learns how to make a proper pot of coffee.

Next, there is Cyrus himself. His character is actually quite well done, and a proper backstory makes it fit together. The problem is that the ending to this story is really really disappointing. An ambiguous ending is not always something bad, but this one was done pretty poorly. ""k imma getchu back later dw about it"" and then he never does. IIRC, villains usually have a proper resolution. One thing I thought of was that Cyrus uses the pokemon you don't get. Most of the story remains the same until Spear Pillar.

\*BIG BLOCK OF TEXT AHEAD\*

First storyline changes: Cyrus doesn't actually give you a Master Ball. Cyrus makes two of them, and keeps them as an emergency plan in case he gets disrupted, to catch Palkia and Dialga. (Basically, in case someone like you decides to interfere with his plans, he can just catch them real quick and run away.) However, after the first battle, as he goes away, you notice he forgets a master ball behind, and that's how you get YOUR master ball.

Cyrus will notice you come and battle you. He'll lose, and attempt to catch both Palkia and Dialga, and fail because he forgot a master ball. Here's where the storyline diverges.

Pearl: Cyrus catches Dialga, and plans on catching Palkia next, but he doesn't know where his other Master Ball is. Furious, he runs away into Giratina's distortion world. You battle Palkia.

Diamond: Cyrus catches Palkia, and plans on catching Dialga next, but he doesn't know where his other Master ball is. Furious, he runs away into Giratina's distortion world. You battle Dialga.

The storylines merge again, and you battle Cyrus, but he has a Dialga on his team now. You battle Giratina. Afterwards, Cyrus swears he'll find his revenge someday, and stays behind in the distortion world. Story progresses as normal, and you finish the game as normal. After putting your pokemon into the Hall of Fame, Cyrus steps in through a portal with Palkia(pearl)/ materializes behind you with Dialga, and says he has everyone in Twinleaf Town kidnapped. Cynthia says for you to go back to Spear Pillar and rescue everyone in the Distortion World, and is about to battle Cyrus, but he has his Palkia/Dialga use Gravity, which he says will affect the whole region, then uses Palkia/Dialga to disappear.

Cynthia asks for you to return to Twinleaf Town to make sure this is true. During this time, Fly will be unusable, and the start of every battle will have the move Gravity permanently in effect. Throughout the whole region, you'll see Grunts taking over the entire region. Grunts are stationed all over at different routes, but more than half of them are stopped by random trainers or Gym Leaders. You'll meet your rival at given points, Cheryl at Eterna City, and the Gym Leaders in their respective cities all fighting Grunts. The Elite Four will be at Sunyshore City, and Cynthia will accompany you.

At Valor Lakefront, Saturn is encountered, and you and Cynthia have a double battle against him and a Grunt. (I'm imagining two seperate pokeball bars for what I'm about to propose.) Grunt's pokemon levels: 50-55. 3 pokemon. Saturn's Pokemon Team: FIVE pokemon: Magmortar Lv 55, Luxray Lv 56, Gallade-Mega Lv 57, Azelf Lv 59, Toxicroak Lv 60. After beating him, Cynthia breaks Azelf's Pokeball, and Azelf returns to what remains of Lake Valor with effort under Palkia's/Dialga's Gravity. Route 213 is blocked, so you have to go through Route 214 into Veilstone City and up to Lake Acuity before Eterna City is accessible by some reason that I don't know yet. He reveals that they want all three Lake Pokemon in order to control the pokemon you possess so Cyrus can have both pokemon again.

You have to fight Jupiter. You have a double battle with Jupiter and a Grunt. Grunt's pokemon levels, 50-55. 3 pokemon. Jupiter's Team: 5 pokemon. Magnezone Lv 56, Gliscor Lv 57, Gardevoir-Mega Lv 59, Uxie Lv 64, Skuntank Lv 65. After defeating her, you can go to Eterna city. Again, Cynthia destroyes Uxie's pokeball, and Uxie returns to Lake Acuity's center with effort.

You have to travel to Verity Lakefront now. Grunts block the way into Route 202. Mars can be seen going to Lake Verity saying she'll blow up Lake Verity, and the player and Cynthia pursue her. There, a double battle will occur with your team and Cynthia's team. Random Grunt with 4 pokemon Lv 60-65. Mars's Team: SIX pokemon. Lv 60 Golbat (Eviolite), Lv 62 Rapidash, Lv 62 Bronzong, Lv 64 Mega Banette, Lv 64 Mesprit, Lv 66 Purugly. After beating her, You can go back into Route 202. Your gender counterpart Lucas/Dawn then shows up. This is when Cynthia will leave you, where she goes to Canalave City to see how Byron is doing. He/she tells you to check Twinleaf Town, because he/she has heard rumors that Cyrus really kidnapped everyone.

If at any point you went through Eterna Forest, you will meet Cheryl, and You, Cynthia, and Cheryl will fight triple battles against any Grunts that appear there.

Major Plot Splits here:

Diamond: You won't be able to enter the Pokemon lab before you enter Twinleaf Town. Once you get there, everyone is gone, and some of the houses are a little smashed up. At this point, your Rival comes and tells you that Sandgem Town is under attack. Once you get there, the Pokemon Lab is completely destroyed, and Prof. Rowan will be in the center of it, saying that the world is doomed. Talking to him again will make him say ""If only I could turn back time"". If you have Dialga in your party, Dialga will bend time backwards to when Cyrus is about to run away after destroying the city. You'll meet Cyrus emerging from a portal thing, and he'll be a little surprised, then he'll monologue. Here, he'll break the Master Ball that holds Palkia, and then use the Red Chain on it. Your Rival will help you in a Double battle against Cyrus alone. Rival's Team: Staraptor Lv 62, Mega Heracross Lv 64, Snorlax Lv 65, Roserade lv 59, Floatzel lv 59, Starter lv 67. Cyrus' Team: Honchkrow Lv 66, Gastrodon Lv 67, Clefable (Unaware) Lv 67, Mega Gyarados Lv 70, Weavile Lv 72, Palkia Lv 70. Palkia gains a ""totem"" effect, which grants it x1.5 to all stats due to it being freed from its pokeball. If Primal Dialga or Primal Palkia are going to be a thing, then the Red Chain causes them to undergo Primal Reversion. Upon defeat, the Red Chain breaks, and Dialga time travels away. Cyrus is defeated, and he breaks down. The Gravity Effect is finally negated, and Cyrus reveals that everyone was held in the old Galactic HQ, and that no one was harmed.

Pearl: You won't be able to enter the Pokemon lab before you enter Twinleaf Town. Once you get there, everyone is gone, and some of the houses are a little smashed up. At this point, your Rival comes and tells you that Sandgem Town is under attack. Once you get there, the Pokemon Lab is completely destroyed, and Prof. Rowan will be in the center of it, saying that the world is doomed. Talking to him again will make him say ""If only I could make Cyrus return and save everyone."" If you have Palkia in your party, Palkia will bend space to force Cyrus and Dialga there. You'll meet Cyrus emerging the future, and he'll be a little surprised, then he'll monologue. Here, he'll break the Master Ball that holds Dialga, and then use the Red Chain on it. Your Rival will help you in a Double battle against Cyrus alone. Rival's Team: Staraptor Lv 62, Mega Heracross Lv 64, Snorlax Lv 65, Roserade lv 59, Floatzel lv 59, Starter lv 67. Cyrus' Team: Honchkrow Lv 66, Gastrodon Lv 67, Clefable (Unaware) Lv 67, Mega Gyarados Lv 70, Weavile Lv 72, Dialga Lv 70. Palkia gains a ""totem"" effect which grants it x1.5 stats due to being freed from its pokeball. If Primal Dialga or Primal Palkia are going to be a thing, then the Red Chain causes them to undergo Primal Reversion. Upon defeat, the Red Chain breaks, and Palkia teleports away. Cyrus is defeated, and he breaks down. The Gravity Effect is finally negated, and Cyrus reveals that everyone was held in the old Galactic HQ, and that no one was harmed.

Ending: Either Cyrus is arrested by an Officer Jenny or something, or some sort of redemption act comes and you act as a therapist to him telling his childhood to you. Honestly, I don't know which would be better. I'm leaning towards redemption.

That was long, right? I basically planned out a pokemon game!

My final idea is for your gender counterpart to pick the last starter, and be battle-able at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

The story assumes you always win. If you don't, against Commanders and Grunts you'll black out like usual. Against Cyrus, Dialga will turn back time to the Sandgem pokemon Center (even if you don't visit it), and Palkia will teleport you to the pokemon Center. I'm imagining the text to be similar to this: ""With the last of their strength, Dialga teleported you back in time to give you another chance./Palkia teleported you away to give you another chance.",,9e9zxr,,0,,false,1540096933,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-18 kantoflair 19 10logo,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9e9zxr/plot_ideas_for_diamond_and_pearl_remakes_long_post/,,rattata,false,Discussion,

So, the main reason for me writing this post is because I don't see Pokémon platinum's storyline being talked about much, if at all, really. I really think it should be though, as not only is it the point where stories have started getting more in-depth, but also because I honestly think there's a lot to this plot that doesn't even get mentioned at all. I understand that there are legit reasons for disliking this plot, but overall, I just feel like it's very (unfairly) ignored - despite it being one of my favorites in the series.

The story kicks off by introducing Team Galactic, the regional villain Team, and their leader, Cyrus; who seeks to eliminate spirit from existence.

In Celestic town, a Galactic Grunt threatens to blow the town up because it is ""insignificant"". This plot point is important, as it establishes Team Galactic as people who see no point to something existing as long as it's ""insignificant"" to them. This applies to Cyrus as well, when he announces his reason for eliminating spirit: because it causes ""*pointless* strife and hostility"". From this quote, it's clear he deems spirit to be something useless that serves no real purpose. Logically, he sees the lake trio -the bringers of spirit- as ""useless"" beings as well; who only serve to get him closer to the Pokémon that *really* mattered to him: Dialga and Palkia.

In Team Galactic's HQ, Cyrus reveals that he'd never planned to let the rest of Team Galactic into his new world, because they are ""uniformly useless"". Noticing your compassion toward your Pokémon, he says: ""How wasteful... Such emotions are but mere illusions. And like all illusions, they fade over time until death banishes them forever"". This quote cements the fact that he sees emotions as nothing more than temporary states of mind that are ultimately meaningless; hence justifying his goal of eliminating them. Nonchalantly, he allows you to free the lake trio, because he's done with them - it's as though they really *are* ""useless"" and completely disposable to him. As you go to do just that, Commander Saturn tells you: ""Team Galactic take what we need, and eliminate what we don't""; further cementing their disdain for things they deem ""useless"".

At Spear Pillar, Cyrus is just about to create his new world - a world without spirit. Just when nobody could stop him, Giratina tears a hole into the weakening fabric of our world, and drags Cyrus along with it to the distortion world. Cynthia arrives then, and you both leap into the distortion world, to stop it from spreading. In there, you both realize that it is completely barren and desolate. No time flows, no space exists, no life survives there. It is the ultimate definition of ""useless"" - even Cynthia wonders what its and Giratina's purpose is. 

Cynthia and Cyrus are both being tested here: they're shoved into a world that goes against everything they've ever known, because on the surface, this world is nothing but an absolute wasteland, and yet it *appears* to be balancing their world. They both have very different reactions to this. Cyrus, thinking that this world is nothing more than Giratina itself, is now counting on you to defeat it and, in turn, destroy both its' and our world. Once again, we see his reductive attitude towards the things he couldn't see significance to: he deems this world to be nothing more than Giratina itself (and vice-versa), and thinks that both worlds are so worthless that they can be destroyed just like that. Cynthia, on the other hand, reassures you: ""There's no way a Pokémon can make the world disappear. The world awaited your birth. Not just yours either. The Pokémon with you, the people close to you. All the people and Pokémon were born because they have a part in the world."" From this quote, we can tell that she believes in the importance of everyone's existence. She still believes this, even after she's been shoved into a world with a being she's yet to figure out the exact purpose of.

Once you've succeeded in capturing/defeating Giratina, we start seeing an entirely new side to Cyrus. He falls victim to the very emotions he had shunned as ""useless"" before: ""The emotions roiling inside me...rage, hatred, frustration...these ugly emotions arise because of my own incomplete spirit!"" He goes off after that, swearing to get his revenge.

""Since there is sadness, we can feel joy."" Says Cynthia. ""When there is anger, compassion is born."" The story then wraps up, with these last two lines stating the importance all emotions -good or bad- have.

Overall, this is a story that takes a fairly original perspective on the average ""take over the world"" plot, and I think it should be commended for that. If it isn't obvious already, I believe this story is a reminder to always appreciate the value and importance of everything/everyone. Execution-wise, the story had a natural flow to it too. It may have taken a long time to build up, but once all the important bits are established, it starts to pick up pace, especially after the lake's bombing - once calm turns into panic.

Rules: they can be from any game and any spinoff games ((Tes this includes Pokemon Showdown)). No shiny hunting stories. They can be both from online and offline as long as they fit the criteria of this post.

I got a one.

The Ghetsis battle in Pokemon Black and White. So we all know about the hydreigon he uses by now. This thing was a fucking nightmare to the fact that it has damn Universal type coverage and it's only trumped by ~~Ultra Necrozma~~ in terms of difficulty. Well I think I have one of the funniest stories about how I was able to beat this thing. So replaying white I caught a vanillish, because why not? It actually serve me pretty well. So I get to the Ghetsis fight beat all the rest of his Pokemon then he sends out his hydreigon. Can't use Emboar because he has Surf so that was out of the question. Can't use Zekrom ~~Ironically~~ because it's going to get destroyed. The only other option I had was vanilluxe. So I send it out forgetting that the hydreigon knows Fire blast. I forgot about this up until I made the input for Ice Beam, and by the time I realized my mistake it was already too late. I pretty much accepted the feet at that point. Then the unthinkable happened. To this day I don't know if it had a good IV in special defense or just it some nature that gave points to special defense, but it survived with literally one or two HP left. Then vanilluxe one shotted the hydreigon with an ice beam. All I could do was look at my DS screen in shock and awe. From that day forward vanilluxe became my favorite ice type until ~~Weavile happened~~ it's still one of my favorite ice types though.

I left off with with RSE in high school, so about a year and half ago My husband and I each bought a ds and Pokémon diamond and pearl. Since then we’ve also played through platinum, heart gold, soul silver, and black and white.


Black 2 and white 2 are our next games to play through. However, we’re getting some money back from our refund check from school, and thought that this would be a good time to treat ourselves to a new 2dsxl and possibly sun and moon. I know sun and moon are out of order as they’re the newest games, but this way I’d be able claim the few codes I’ve managed to get from GameStop. 


My absolute main objective is to complete the infamous living Pokédex. I know I can catch quite a few myself. But I had a couple questions:


Back before I stopped playing, I was attempting a living Pokédex on my leaf green. I’ve since transferred over most of my important Pokémon on to Pokémon pearl, such as legendaries and starters, which will eventually be transferred to Pokémon black and then to pokebank once I get my 2dsxl. However I still have a bunch of physical copies of fully evolved Pokémon and others on my leaf green, probably close to 100 if I had to guess off the top of my head. So my first question is, is it worth the time to transfer all of those, six at a time, to pearl, and then again, six at a time, to black, and then eventually to pokebank? Or am I better off to just grind when I get XYORAS? 


And my second question: How likely am I to receive help from trading? I’m going to try to catch most of the Pokémon myself, but I’m definitely open to trading. My issue is, I don’t have a lot to trade in return. Should I grind on DPP to get extra legendaries to trade? And same with BW? Or are people generally good at just giving Pokémon away? 


Sorry for all the questions and long post, I know I’m pretty much a noob at this but I appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks in advance and thanks for reading!

I remember my first Elite 4 Team, [Venusaur, Lapras, Hitmonlee, Gengar, Golem, and Moltres](https://i.redd.it/czy6gs7kkvk11.png). At that point I brute forced my way through the Elite 4 in Pokemon Red. If I remember correctly my team average level ended up being like 67 so I was able to just smash skulls against Lorelei using Lapras. Stomp Bruno with Venusaur, Lapras, and Moltres. Roll over Agatha with Golem. And beat Lance with Lapras. Then beat Blue with my team. I was a dumb kid so I did wipe once against Lance but I think I am still most proud of that first team. It was a real sense of accomplishment to figure out how to get to the top, I didn't have the internet so I had to figure it out on my own.

My team wasn't equipped all that great, gen 1 EV's are a mess to understand even if 6 year old me knew what they were, and I thought that equipping Pokemon with the same type moves made sense so my Venusaur I think had Razor Leaf as well as Solar Beam. Type coverage didn't exist for me but I still mustered my way through the crucible.

I had originally asked if anyone else remembered their original Elite 4 team, but after talking on the previous thread with a couple redditors, I think a more interesting question is what's the team you're most proud of forming? I've been playing Ultra Moon with my friend [Hannah](https://youtu.be/niQUxJwfMF8)and it's been really interesting to see her choices as she's going through the game.

I've decided to fulfill the childhood dream of mine! My parents thought gameboys are too small to spend too much money on, and I only ever managed to get them to buy me a gameboy colour and one Pokemon game. It was also well after all my friends were into Pokemon (they all got into Playstation, which is what I got when everyone were into Gameboy lol) so no one was interested in trading anymore. So I never managed to get all the Pokemon from the first two generations.  


Almost 20 years later I decided I'll do it on my own (or well, with some help from my gf). I want to get two copies of handhelds and get through all the games, and ultimately get to the last generation with all the original 251 Pokemon caught, minus those that are still event only, such as Celebi, and after that I'll start going after all the other generations. 

I was hoping someone knows a good combo that would help me achieve this. I was thinking about buying a used Nintendo ds so I can buy some old cartridges, and a new 3DS cause I'd love to have the latest one. These two should be able to handle all the old to current games, no?  And I know that the first 2 generation games Pokemon can't be traded into gen 3 games. So if I'm not mistaken LeafGreen, FireRed, SoulSilver, HeartGold, and Emerald for Mew should be all I need to capture all the Pokemon, minus Celebi, correct? After this, I should be able to trade my way up to gen VI, and once I'm there I can use the Pokemon bank.

  
Am I missing something, and are there any tips to do this as painless as possible?

I'm Ferretsroq, your friendly local VGC casual. If you didn't know, VGC 2019 is starting its new format much earlier this year. In fact, it's starting tomorrow, September 4th, with Championship Battle on Battle Spot updating to the new format. If you're unfamiliar with the coming year's format, it will be split into three series - Sun, Moon, and Ultra. For the next few months we'll be playing in the Sun series:

* All battles will be Double Battles played in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Pokémon Ultra Moon.

* All Pokémon from National Pokédex No. 001 through 807 are allowed, with the following restrictions:

* Mythical Pokémon and Ash-Greninja are not permitted.

* Players may only include two of the following Pokémon in their teams: Mewtwo, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, Reshiram, Zekrom, Kyurem, Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, Cosmog, Cosmoem, Solgaleo, Lunala, Necrozma.

* Pokémon must have the Alola symbol, showing they were caught in the Alola region.

* Duplicate Pokémon are not allowed.

* Duplicate held items are not allowed.

* All Pokémon are set to Lv. 50, including Pokémon below Lv. 50.

* Players will have 7 minutes of Your Time, up from 5 minutes in 2018.

**Sun Series**

**September 4, 2018–January 7, 2019**

* Z-Crystals and Mega Stones are not permitted.

* Blue Orb and Red Orb items are not permitted.

* Rayquaza may not know the move Dragon Ascent.

**TL;DR VGC 2016, no primals, no mega Rayquaza, no megas, no z-moves. All else is game.**

And the cool part is that the fine folks at /r/stunfisk have already updated [their monthly circuit and weekly tournaments](https://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/9be00d/want_to_get_some_early_practice_in_for_vgc_19_in/) for the Sun Series! On top of being a fun day of battling, they're also giving out legendaries every week for participants. Fun times!

I played in the tournament on September 1st, and technically placed second due to two people tying for first. So I thought I'd pretend like I'm one of those important players that has smart things to say about their teams and write up a team report! Fun!

#Thoughts on the Sun Format

Before I get into the team, first I want to go over my initial thoughts on the format, and why I made the choices I did. The first thing I thought when I saw the changes were that Xerneas is going to be completely busted. Xerneas had a couple of big checks in 2016 - Primal Groudon could tank its Fairy attacks and hit its weaker Defense, Mega Rayquaza with a Swords Dance could deal tons of damage with Extremespeed, Mega Mawile could easily OHKO most Xerneas with Iron Head, Mega Gengar could trap Xerneas into a bad matchup. All of those checks are now gone. And we also can't use z-moves to sneak in a surprise OHKO on the turn Xerneas uses Geomancy. This thing is going to be a monster. So I started thinking about what checks do still exist, and what new checks have been introduced in gen 7:

* Bronzong is still around and has not been changed. If anything, Bronzong is stronger now that Smeargle lost Dark Void, so Gravity is less punishing vs Xerneas/Smeargle teams.

* Ferrothorn is also still a monster, and doesn't have to fear Primal Groudon being on every single team. 

* Stakataka is a new pokemon with enormous bulk and an absurdly good Gyro Ball. With access to Trick Room, Beast Boost enabling snowballing, and the ability to comfortably 1v1 Xerneas, this pokemon is pretty high on my list.

* Solgaleo/Necrozma Dusk Mane are new restricteds with access to Sunsteel Strike. Either of these pokemon can easily OHKO most Xerneas, and have a lot going for them. Although they're pretty different pokemon, they both serve the same role of a Xerneas check for my purposes.

* Kartana is an odd one. She's one of the fastest and definitely the strongest physical Steel-type attacker. However, her abysmal Special Defense makes her riskier to use against Xerneas, who can still win a 1v1 vs Kartana. I think this pokemon is an acceptable Xerneas check, but definitely can't be the only one on your team.

* Fake Out is still Fake Out. All Fake Outs are still good against Xerneas, and Wolfe Glick showed us all the power of cycling Fake Out in and out at worlds 2016. Incineroar definitely won't be the same monster in 2019 that he was in 2018, but it's one of the better Fake Out pokemon, and that makes it decent against Xerneas.

In addition to Xerneas, I identified Kyogre as one of the most dangerous pokemon in the format. ""Bulky Water"" has been an archetype from the very beginning of the series, and Kyogre is the perfect bulky Water. Without Primal Groudon to cancel its Water attacks, Kyogre can now start attacking freely. There are only a few relevant checks that came to mind for me:

* Tapu Koko has been good for the last two years, and can still put in massive work against Kyogre. Despite Kyogre's Special Defense stat of 140, Tapu Koko is still one of the strongest Electric attackers in the game. I think we'll see a few more physical Koko running around than before specifically to hit Kyogre's weaker Defense, but even specially offensive Koko can reliably KO faster no-bulk Kyogres.

* Tapu Bulu is, in my opinion, the strongest non-restricted pokemon in the format right now. Kyogre can't do anything to him, and he hits way too hard. This one is super straightforward.

* Kartana shows up here again. Similar to Xerneas, Kartana *can* win vs Kyogre, but still has to fear eating special attacks. In a good position, Kartana is probably the best answer to Kyogre. In a bad position, Kartana is useless against Kyogre.

* Ferrothorn is here again. Ferrothorn wins vs Kyogre like few others. Kyogre is not only weak to Ferrothorn's Power Whip, but the rain it brings with Drizzle helps Ferrothorn avoid the Fire damage it fears so much. Ferrothorn won't OHKO Kyogre, but it will absolutely win the long game against it.

So with all those thoughts in mind, on to the team!

#The Team

[Importable Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/X2LKPsFu)

This early into the format, I don't find a lot of value in playing with more complicated EV spreads. All of these are simple 252/252 spreads until I get a better feel for the format and can make some real spreads.

**Kyogre** @ Wiki Berry  

Ability: Drizzle  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA  

Bold Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  

- Scald

- Ice Beam  

- Thunder Wave  

- Protect  

This Kyogre set is off-meta and inspired by RyuzakiVGC's Primal Kyogre I saw her use on stream one time in 2016. I don't know the exact spread on that one, but I know it was a bulky supportive Primal Kyogre, which blew my mind. Thunder Wave has been nerfed, but is still powerful. A paralyzed Xerneas might as well be a dead Xerneas with the powerful physical attackers I have on my team. This Kyogre is max HP max Defense to eat up damage for days. This Kyogre survives an unboosted 252+ Attack Kartana Leaf Blade. And outside of Grassy Terrain, this Kyogre also survives 252+ Attack Bulu's Wood Hammer 100% of the time. Both of these have come in clutch enough times that I don't really see myself running any other Kyogres. Most Kyogres are running Modest/Timid with a scarf, or just generally running more offensive sets with Water Spout/Origin Pulse. Since mine isn't nearly as offensive, I opted for no spread attacks at all. I've gotten a lot done off the back of people using Wide Guard to protect against a Water Spout that never comes, and even in a bo3 format like the /r/stunfisk tournament, this Kyogre is a reliable pokemon. 

**Solgaleo** @ Choice Band  

Ability: Full Metal Body  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  

Jolly Nature  

- Sunsteel Strike  

- Flare Blitz  

- Crunch  

- Wild Charge  

Earlier, I identified Solgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozma as being Xerneas checks. They're similar pokemon with some important differences. Solgaleo is faster with a lower Attack, has higher hp but lower defenses, and is immune to Intimidate. Dusk Mane Necrozma has Photon Geyser and Trick Room, Solgaleo has Flare Blitz and Wild Charge. Overall, I made the call that being immune to Intimidate is better than having 20 more points in Attack, and the difference in bulk was relatively small with Solgaleo's higher hp. I was not disappointed with Solgaleo. Being immune to Intimidate and reliably getting OHKOs on Xerneas, Kyogre, Kartana, and Bulu is huge. I think this spread is bad, but this early in the format it works well. In the future I will almost certainly move away from Choice Band and invest more in bulk. Still, Solgaleo puts in way too much damage and is criminally underused at the moment. I brought Solgaleo to every single game this tournament, and if I could go back in time I would still bring it to every match. This pokemon hits almost every restricted pokemon people are using for super-effective damage, is immune to intimidate, and has the bulk to eat super-effective attacks in return. The biggest problem for Solgaleo is Groudon, who is regularly running both Precipice Blades and Fire Punch, and Solgaleo can't do too much in return. This Solgaleo's best option for hitting Groudon is to use Flare Blitz in the sun, which does over 50%. However, between the recoil and an incoming Precipice Blades, Solgaleo won't last too long against Groudon.

**Crobat** @ Focus Sash  

Ability: Inner Focus  

Level: 50  

EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  

Timid Nature  

- Tailwind  

- Super Fang  

- Sludge Bomb  

- Quick Guard  

Speaking of criminally-underused pokemon that stood out to me as clear favorites, Crobat deserves way better than he's getting. This pokemon was used in Big 6 as a viable alternative to Talonflame in 2016, and was then later used on Primal Kyogre/Mega Rayquaza/Mega Gengar teams as a disruptive support. Mine is a little different, investing in Special Attack and not using Taunt. So far, Crobat has been a very effective disruptive support pokemon. He has Tailwind and immunity to Fake Out, which can put a game in my favor right from turn one. Super Fang turns 2HKOs into OHKOs and weakens Kyogre's Water Spouts. Any fancy EVing people have done to avoid dying to Solgaleo or Tapu Bulu go out the window after Super Fang. Sludge Bomb hits all four Tapus for decent damage, and OHKOs non-AV Bulu. Even AV Bulu with no other Special Defense investment has a 1/16 chance to die to one Sludge Bomb. Quick Guard is probably the weirdest choice here, but it exists just to beat Xerneas teams that rely on Fake Out support. My standard lead against any Xerneas team is Crobat/Solgaleo, and go for the Quick Guard/Sunsteel Strike on turn one to block a Fake Out and KO Xerneas. A couple of the players I played against credited Crobat for winning games for me, and they're not wrong. This thing is a beast.

**Incineroar** @ Figy Berry  

Ability: Intimidate  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD  

Adamant Nature  

- Fake Out  

- Flare Blitz  

- Knock Off  

- U-turn  

This is a bad Incineroar set, but I think Incineroar is still good. This set doesn't survive any of the important attacks I need it to. Kyogre easily OHKOs just by looking in Incineroar's direction. Without an Intimidate, Groudon still KOs with Precipice Blades. Tons of pokemon put damage on this Incineroar. I definitely need to rework the EVs on this to put bulk in the right places instead of a lazy 252/252 spread. That said, Fake Out is still excellent, and Intimidate is also excellent. Incineroar's role on this team is to cycle in and out to Intimidate the problematic Groudons, Bulus, and Kartanas I keep seeing everywhere. Knock Off has received an indirect buff in the Sun Series, since mega stones and z crystals are banned, meaning almost every pokemon will have items that can be knocked off. As far as I'm aware, only Giratina-O's Griseous Orb is still immune to being knocked off. Incineroar is more of a filler pokemon on this team, when I know that Intimidate+Fake Out will be good, but I don't plan on keeping him around for very long. I feel like if I cut any member of my team, it will be this Incineroar.

**Tapu Bulu** @ Assault Vest  

Ability: Grassy Surge  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD  

Adamant Nature  

- Wood Hammer  

- Horn Leech  

- Stone Edge  

- Superpower  

I've talked up Tapu Bulu a lot already, and I'm gonna do it some more. This pokemon is the best non-restricted pokemon in the format, at least for now. Grassy Terrain boosts his damage to absurd levels, his physical attacks bypass the many special walls, he can easily OHKO Kyogre and Groudon, and puts in a lot of work against Xerneas. Even without a lot of investment in Special Defense, Bulu survives tons of attacks that people expect to otherwise kill. Without Grassium Z, I think Assault Vest is really the only sensible item to put on Bulu, outside of a potential Poison resist berry if Gengar gets more popular. Stone Edge is on this Bulu because I felt I was looking a little weak to Ho-Oh, since my Kyogre isn't strong enough to OHKO it. Superpower is for hitting Stakataka, and also Incineroar if I really have no better choices. My general game plan is to get Bulu in against a Groudon or Kyogre, and then Horn Leech my way to victory. Nobody seems to be respecting the power of Tapu Bulu, though I expect that will change as we get more into the format.

**Tapu Koko** @ Life Orb  

Ability: Electric Surge  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  

Timid Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  

- Thunderbolt  

- Volt Switch  

- Dazzling Gleam  

- Hidden Power [Fire]  

I've actually never used a specially offensive Koko before. All through 2017 and 2018 I swore by physical Choice Band Tapu Koko. I've finally relented, and am consistently surprised by the damage that Koko puts out. Terrain wars aren't as common now as they were the last two seasons, so Koko can more reliably get his Electric Terrain up and start shooting Thunderbolts every turn. Sadly, his movepool still kinda sucks. I may replace Volt Switch with Protect, as I was expecting to Volt Switch into Incineroar more often. However, I've never actually been in a situation where this feels like the correct play. Hidden Power Fire seems mandatory to me, as Ferrothorn gives this team some trouble. The only other Fire attacks I've got are Flare Blitzes on Incineroar and Solgaleo. While those are good against Ferrothorn, I consider that a method of last resort compared to HP Fire. Koko helps my team a little versus Ho-Oh and Kyogre, and the Electric Terrain also helps block Amoonguss/Smeargle trying to pull Spore shenanigans. I'm not super thrilled with Tapu Koko on this team, but his fast damage output is always good to have. I think he fits well enough here, but I may switch him out for a different special attacker in this spot.


TL;DR This team is relatively bulky, relies heavily on Crobat support. Weak match-up vs Groudon teams. Also somewhat weak matchup vs Stakataka Trick Room teams.

#The Tournament

The /r/stunfisk tournament had 24 participants, and took place over 5 rounds of Swiss. Every match was bo3, with no team-switching between games, though team-switching was allowed between matches. I stuck to the same team for every match. I went 4-1 in series and 9-4 in games overall. I was the only one to go 4-1 and technically got second place, though two people tied for first, making me more like a third place. Still, I'm pretty satisfied with how well I did with a somewhat off-meta team. Here are all the replays from my games:

Round 1 - vs Yondaime

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799246790

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799249060

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799250928

Yondaime had two main modes to his team - rain and Geomancy. I stuck to my standard Solgaleo/Crobat lead to cover the Xerneas, though it was somewhat weak to the rain mode. A misclick cost me game 2, when I intended to Sludge Bomb Ludicolo but accidentally hit Quick Guard against two pokemon that didn't have a priority attack to use that turn. The double Fake Out pressure from Incineroar+Ludicolo was tough to deal with, but Yondaime made a big misplay in game 3 by not realizing my Crobat had Inner Focus. Yondaime didn't bring Xerneas to any of the games, and Tapu Bulu was able to do Tapu Bulu things freely.

WIN 2-1

Round 2 - vs VolcanoShed

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799264438

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799266978

I knew going into this that Stakataka was a big problem for me. Game one I made a big blunder by predicting a Kyogre switch and wasting a turn Wild Charging into the Stakataka. Still, I was able to get a Tailwind up as Trick Room ended, and Tapu Bulu was again able to carry me pretty hard in game one, eating tons of attacks from the Hitmontop and KO'ing the Kyogre. I think this game would have been very different had Yondaime actually put more effort into KO'ing Crobat, instead of letting it constantly attack. Game 2 I broke my usual lead to instead counter the Stakataka lead. In this game we got to see a whiffed Wide Guard, but unfortunately the Xerneas got its Geomancy up. Still, once Xerneas is paralyzed, Solgaleo/Tapu Bulu are an unstoppable force that can take on anything left on his team. Overall, I identified from the beginning that as long as I can get Tapu Bulu attacking, I was going to win these games, and that's exactly what happened.

WIN 2-0

Round 3 - vs KamikazeKidGC

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799284516

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799287827

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799289348

My one loss. This guy absolutely destroyed me, no doubts about it. Groudon, Trick Room, and Tapu Lele are somewhat problematic for me. I also foolishly couldn't deal with the Togetic in game one, and was scared of it for the rest of the series. I made a huge mistake by not using Crobat as much as I could have, and I probably should have brought Koko over Bulu. Pretty much every turn in the games I lost, I got straight-up outplayed. Game 3 especially, I just got absolutely demolished. Nothing to blame except my own bad plays here, gg to KamikazeKidGC.

LOSE 1-2

Round 4 - vs Shkitzz

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799296145

Forgot to save game 2, woops

Classic case of Groudon giving me some trouble. Game 1 I was saved by my opponent not realizing that Grass types ignore Rage Powder. If he'd Clear Smog'd me that turn instead, I would have lost. I don't remember game 2, but I do recall this being a tough matchup for me. The Amoonguss gave me all sorts of problems next to the Groudon, which scared me out of running Koko. In the future against teams like this, I should probably bring Tapu Koko and play way more aggressively. 

WIN 2-0

Round 5 - vs Typod2468

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799308888

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799310278

https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen7vgc2019sunseries-799311793

I'll admit that I really wanted to beat this guy because he had been trash-talking in the discord even before the tournament had started. So beating him felt pretty good. This guy also ran a Stakataka/Xerneas team. I'll admit that I don't quite understand why people are using both of these on the same team, since Trick Room is Xerneas' worst nightmare. Once I saw the Stakataka, I incorrectly assumed that Xerneas wasn't getting brought to the battle, and was caught off-guard. Still, I was in a good enough position game 1 when the Xerneas came out that it didn't matter. Solgaleo does not fear Xerneas, even after a Geomancy. Game 2 I got the Quick Guard/Sunsteel Strike combo to OHKO Xerneas turn one, and thought I had this game locked up. However, then Stakataka comes out and ruins my day. I played very poorly around Trick Room and wound up losing. Game 3 I was much more prepared for the Trick Room, and brought Kyogre. If I'm being totally honest, this was another misclick. I intended to lead Crobat/Solgaleo again, but accidentally put in Kyogre as a lead. Still, it worked out great. For some reason he used Geomancy with 3 turns of Trick Room left and just let Solgaleo/Kyogre sweep through his whole team. This game was a pretty perfect example of how much damage Solgaleo and Kyogre can both do when nothing is in position to stop them.

WIN 2-1

OVERALL - 4-1 in matches, 9-4 in games

He’s just one of the coolest looking Pokemon from gen 1 IMO. Other than an obvious Toxic Bind situation how can I make Onix as good as he deserved to be? 
My list for coolest looking gen 1 Pokemon (with a auto disadvantage to legendaries) would probably look something like this in no particular order: 
Onix, Scyther, Beedrill, Kabutops, Electabuzz, Charizard, Gyarados, Golem, Nidoking, Machamp, Lapras, Aerodactyle, Pinscer, Victoreebell, Vaporeon.

I want to make a team of Onix, Venusaur, Scyther, Beedrill, Tauros, and Kabutops. That’s my plan anyway, I just like using the cool looking ones for the most part. Any help making Scyther and Beedrill not suck as well would be helpful! Might try substitute/double team combos for them or something.

It doesn't matter what game, handheld, console, app you were playing either.

I'll go first:

2007, I'm doing my first playthrough of Pokémon Colosseum. I haven't saved the game in over an hour and I'm fighting the boss that has Shadow Raikou. It's down to Umbreon and Raikou; Umbreon is in the yellow, Raikou is in the red. My heart is pounding hard and I'm practically vibrating as I go into my inventory only to realize that I only have 10 plain pokéballs left.

I have a choice to make: end it and never get the Raikou, or try the pokéballs. I choose to try the catch.

First pokéball fails and Raikou attacks, and I know its over... except that Umbreon dodges the attack?! I have been given a second chance! The second pokéball rattles and I watch without breathing.

1... 2... 3...

I did it? I really caught Shadow Raikou in a plain pokéball on the second try? 

Obviously this was the most intensely emotional moment of my pre-teens. I still can't believe that I did it with only the teeny tiny percent chance of the pokéball holding. 

This is also the story of why Raikou is my favorite legendary.

Based on a super successful event we've been hosting on [our partnered Discord server](http://www.discord.gg/pokemon), we're back with another round of **Mystery 'Mon Mondays!!** Much like the popular TV show commercial break special, *Who's That Pokémon?*, it will be your job to tell us the mystery Pokémon... BUT WITH A TWIST!

Every Monday morning we'll post a cropped section of a Pokémon. Here are the rules:

* The cropped section will be from an official rendering of the Pokémon. This could be Sugimori art, Dream World art, a sprite, TCG art, or any other piece of official art.
* The cropped section will have a filter applied to it to distort it just a bit. This filter may alter the color just a *slight* bit, but we don't mess with stuff like the rotation or saturation.
* The Pokémon may or may not be shiny. If it's shiny, you will need to specify that in your guess.
* If the Pokémon has multiple forms, you will need to specify the form in your guess.
* At the end of the day we'll award users who guess correctly one point on our scoreboard.
* Once you've submitted a guess for the week's picture, you cannot submit a second one.
* **Users with 5 correct guesses will earn themselves a nifty ball-flair**

## Submit your guess as a one word answer [in this Direct Message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Mystery-Mon&amp;subject=Mystery+%27Mon+%2333)

Please note that we've been informed that there have been some issues with the bot not working right. We hope to have these issues fixed soon, but we'll also be checking PMs sent to the /u/Mystery-Mon account in the meantime. Once the bot's fixed, we'll also recheck past weeks' entries to make sure we've got them all counted correctly!

*Without further ado,*

I decided to start from Gen 1 and go to Gen VII filling in a living dex. I don't know if it is currently possible since some of the pokemon were event only pokemon but I am going to fill in as much as I can while I wait for the next gen to come out. 

Now, I know that I can get many if not most of the pokemon in US/UM right now but that is not my goal. I already have one living dex but I completed that a long time ago and wanted to challenge myself to do it again where I start back at my beginnings and work up to the current gen.

That being said I do have some rules for me to make this a little more challenging but still keep it fun.

1. All pokemon must be caught legitimately. (I.E. no gameshark or other hacking.)
2. No using glitches to get pokemon or items.
3. Every Pokemon must be nicknamed.
4. You cannot obtain pokemon from anyone other then yourself. In game trades are not allowed. (This means I must play multiple iterations of a generation to ""catch 'em all"".
5. Touch trade is allowed.
6. Gifted or bought pokemon in game don't count towards in game trades. (i.e. Porygon from the Game Corner)
7. Event pokemon can be used to fill the dex. (i.e. Special pichu to get Celebi in HG/SS)

I want this to be a legit living dex with many if not all of them caught in their original region. I know I can get mew from 4th gen and many of the legendary pokemon show up in US/UM but they are going to be an exception rather than the rule. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is interested in my progress I have a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjeeq9S-nXhdUAGSpDqtomsZkPYrsSiSfNsRsLiBM70/edit?usp=sharing) with all the Pokemon names in it as well as type and then where I caught them and what name I gave them. 

Any ideas or suggestions on how to streamline the process or any other words for me I would love to see them!

But in the original series, Brock and Misty are gym leaders at the Pewter City and Cerulean City gyms respectively. They tag along with Ash as he goes on his journey to the Pokémon League.

 But how come no one along the way recognises them? Aren’t the eight gym leaders supposed to be these famous trainers that nearly everyone, especially other trainers, would know about. Fair enough when Ash first meets Misty he doesn’t know who she is, he is a bit of a dummy, and he doesn’t know a thing about the Pewter City gym leader when he first arrives. But at the Indigo Plateau, there are 200 trainers, all with eight badges, meaning they would have beaten Brock and Misty. Not one of them says anything about them, and the announcer during Ash’s battles just says they are his coaches. No one says “Hey, how come that kid has two gym leaders as his coaches?”

 Now I understand that if the trainers went to the gyms after they left to go with Ash, they would not have seen them, and if they are like Ash and stupid, not know who they are. But even Gary, who is always ahead of Ash, meaning he would have defeated Brock first, doesn’t recognise him the first time he sees him with Ash. Why not?

Voice acting is something that helps games to show story in a more immersive way, without you having to read everything. Pokemon has had a lot of focus on story in the more recent generations, and the story parts surely would feel more enjoyable and alive, even if pretty much only key cut-scenes are voice-acted like in Zelda: BotW.

I'm just not sure if the effort would be worth it. Considering that Pokemon is also a game for children, it would be necessary to have voice actors for every language of the game, since you can't really expect French, German, Italian, Chinese etc. 10 year olds to understand English or even Japanese. And there are also a lot of Pokemon players who don't care for the story at all, and they would likely not appreciate the voice acting that much.",,9cm66z,,0,,false,1540068964,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,4-5 formsflair a37,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9cm66z/voice_acting_in_future_pokemon_games_good_or_bad/,,,false,Discussion,

Now there are various reasons for why people enjoy Pokemon which mainly are:   

* Adventure and Dramatic encounters, a good story and lore setting basically.   
* Awesome combat and exploration. 
* Strategy and being the best.   
* Lewding Pokemon.    

Many mechanics of Pokemon are iconic to how the series work, I am going to bring some personal bias here and say that Sun and Moon took a bold step to remove the traditional Gym battles and add trials which had a more focus on adventure. Many people say that the trials are tough but all I can say is Git Good you normie.     

You see the new mechanic is trying to appeal a more wide demographic of players which I believe is a good step in the right direction.   

Now I have read many posts and studied videos by the Pokemon community and have encountered some common repulsive mechanics from the game:   

* Too much downtime.   
* Pokemon battles, and animations/models not feeling dynamic enough.   
* Useless Tutorials and Restricted gameplay over-all.    
* SHUT THE FUCK UP ROTOM DEX.     

You see overall there is nothing really wrong with Pokemon as a whole, but it's mechanics have made enjoyment a tedious process.  

***Okay to make this easier let us assume you have an option to play a game. It is not a mainline game, no one is disturbing the formula you love, or a spin-off you would love to hate on. Just a game you have an option to play besides all the other games you have played. But we will use the mainline games as an example of the mechanics we are used to for all these years.***   

My main goal here is to see what mechanics would you people love, and why? It is tough to add mechanics which would appeal both new and experienced players. But let's see.   

Please give your suggestions? It can be anything!

Wormadam is a pokemon I’ve grown to love a lot lately, despite all of its flaws, and personally I feel among all bug types (heck even among all pokemon in honey trees and stuff) Wormadam needs the most love.

So here’s what I’d suggest to improve the poor little bagworm (I’d do this for mothim but he’s most likely beyond saving).

Give all of them a decent boost in stats, like 30 to their primary stats (the physical stuff for sand, the special stuff for leaf, and the defenses for trash), as well as giving them a 10-15 boost for the opposite (so special stuff for sand, physical for leaf, and Offensive stuff for trash).

In addition I’d like to give them maybe 20 extra points in HP, just to help their added defense.

Speed doesn’t need to be changed because they aren’t about speed.

Lastly I feel maybe a unique ability to help them survive longer would be nice, maybe something akin to multiscale but doesn’t go away if you lose health (broken on other mons, but c’mon it’s wormadam.

Also maybe add a seaweed cloak that’s bug water and is more offensively focused.

Anyways that’s my little bit on why I feel Wormadam needs buffing/what I’d personally do to buff it.

1536006805,pokemon,irritatedanus,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9coylh/game_breaking_pokemon_crystal_glitch/,7,13,,,Game breaking Pokemon crystal glitch," I found this hack when I was browsing forums of glitches for pokemon crystal.  There was this really long and obscure post from 2003 or something.  It had a lot more detail than my post because the guy who made it spent hundreds of hours fully exploring this glitch.  I have only performed it around five times successfully, but I can at least report my findings.  I have looked for hours for the forum that I saw this glitch on, however, i cant find it.  Its not even registered on bulbapedia or any other websites that i know of.  If anyone knows what im talking about or where to find it, plz tell me.

Essentially this glitch boils down to the cloning glitch, but done enough to where it eventually switches movesets, stats, names, and potentially IVs between two pokemon in your party.  Since IVs determine shininess, then you can make any existing pokemon you have shiny.  The hardest part of this is guiding the process to get the desired outcome.

Useful for:
Making any pokemon shiny
Giving any pokemon any moves
Unlimited possibilities

Bad stuff:
Takes a long time
Does not corrupt save file or game, but can result in corrupted pokemon so set aside a special box for the failures

Step 1. Obtain shiny gyrados from lake of rage, find an item to duplicate.  Then find the pokemon in which you want to get shiny.  Typically this pokemon will also recieve the same name as your gyrados and sometimes its IVs as well as learnset and moveset.  This can be reversed by visiting the day care people, and then your desired pokemon will be shiny and have its learnset back.  I am unsure about its IVs, however, it very well might keep gyrados's.  Other times, the end result will be a fake, where it shows the sprite of the desired Pokémon as shiny, but when given to the day care people, it turns into gyrados.

Step 2. Go to the pc and save facing it, but not actually interacting with it.  Ensure that there are only three pokemon in your party, with gyrados and the desired pokemon holding onto items you wish to duplicate.  The final pokemon should be a pokemon you do not care about, because if shit hits fan, this one will be corrupted.

Step 3. Deposit both the gyrados and desired pokemon into an empty box.  Cloning two pokemon at the same time is much more efficient and is basically the only way to get this to work.  Exit the pc and make your character face left.  Save the game and a 1/2 second after it says ""dont turn the power off"" turn the game off.  

Step 4. Turn the game back on.  If your character is facing left, then you turned the game off too late.  If your character is facing forward, then you either did it right or you turned the game off too early.  Either way, by looking at the alignment of the character, you can time the cloning better.  Getting the timing right can drastically reduce the time it takes to complete this glitch.  

Step 5. Check the pc.  If you have a set of shiny gyrados and desired pokemon(ill refer to this as the 'target') in both the PC and your party then you have completed the first step of the glitch.   It is recommended that you set aside a perfect copy of your two cloning pokemon in case something goes wrong.  If you set aside a perfect copy of your pokemon in a different box, repeat the previous few steps until you have another cloned pair of pokemon.

Step 6.  Put the cloned pair from your box in your party.  The order of your party should now be: A low leveled disposable pokemon, and then two pairs of clones.  It is important that the clones dont get out of the alternating order; ie A, B , A, B.  

Step 7. Repeat the saving process for these four clones.  After the saving process is complete there should be 8 clones in both your party and your box.  Then repeat the process three more times until you have 20 total clones.  Deposit the four clones in your party into the box to completely fill it up.  

Step 8. Now exit the pc and face left just as should have been done for the previous clonings.  Save the game but now turn the system off about 1/4 of a second after you read ""dont turn off the power"".  This is the trickiest part.  It usually takes around 5 or six tries to get the timing right, but it gets easier with practice.  You will know it is successful by:
A( happens nearly every time). The names of the pokemon are switched
B (This is the second most common). The the sprites are switched, but the moves remain the same
C. The moves are switched
D.  The ivs of them are switched

Step 9.
The way you can differentiate between option B and D is by giving the pokemon to the day care people.  If it retains its shinyness, then it is a genuine and the ivs are switched.  If it changes back to its original form, then it is a sprite.  If you got a sprite then dont despair.  The pokemon can still learn the same moves its sprite learns either by leveling or tm.  This is what allows you to give any pokemon any move.  I suggest doing this glitch with a smeargle because with sketch, you can easily give your pokemon great moves.  

Anyways, thats the gist of it.  If you're like me, you'll end up with a team of all shiny lv 100 monsters that all know spore, sacred fire, etc.  If there are any questions i will try to answer.

He'd probably be intimidated by Misty if she was still around somehow. 

I think he would be patient with Max but secretly kind of annoyed by the hyperactive kid. 

His hypothetical interactions with Ash are not hard to imagine, our lovable Japanese boy from Tokyo has met many characters with personalities similar to Wally, its how he interacts with May that seems a bit problematic since they are very different people. 

I know we will likely never see him in animated form, and it really hurts to know that since he is one of my favorite human characters from the video-games.

Is it time to remove it like how HM Slaves are now a thing of the past?,"Individual Values has been one of the Main Series elusive game design elements so that it can fit with Tajiri’s and Masuda’s philosophy that each and every single Pokémon encounter is a special and unique Pokémon. But for competitive Pokémon battlers and RPG fans that know video game design, it is more or less the last game design element not visible to all fans, and the culprit to hold the most effective HIDDEN POWER TYPE and holds the most stats in any RPG.

The question I have is, “Should the INDIVIDUAL VALUES game design mechanic be removed from the game? Why or why not?”

Based on what I know and understand on “Accepted Modern RPG game design elements”, Pokémon started making EFFORT VALUES visible and present alongside with convenience for all players to use even though the single player campaign NEVER DIRECTLY teaches it to the players. BUT IVs are not so clearly mentioned to all players and it’s game design impact to competitive battling as a whole. Thus, if we are currently seeing that some Pokémon in LG:PE are getting stat buffs, would the games after let’s go finally remove this seemingly bad game design called INDIVIDUAL VALUES and just stick to buffing every other Pokémon that are not competitively viable while nerfing the unneeded overpowered Pokémon species like what they are doing to the PIKACHU and EEVEE Species as a whole?

So what about hidden power?

Obviously this isn't allowed because of moves or abilities that can no longer be learned in the new games and to even out the playing field.
However pokemon with allowed abilities and moves which only lack the current generation symbol shouldn't be blocked from usage. Otherwise you have to train and catch the exact same pokemon and train it even tough you already have one.

-after pokemon xy We expect pokemon Z, we got pokemon oras and then later pokemon sun and moon.

-We expect diamond and pearl remake or pokemon stars, we got ultra sun and moon.

-We expect gen 8, we got let's go pikachu and eevee.

If this goes trend continue, gen 0 will probably be the best bet.

It would make sense though as a game developer and a business move, you can explore so many new fantasy gameplay ideas that would never be possible in a modern era. Is also a perfect way that you can bring back the traditional pokemon game we know while adding a bigger twist, without fearing newcomers will not be up to speed, without the need for gen 1 pandering no less.

I only know 3 or 4 other people with Switch so I can't really play with others. Plus, I'll be on the subway for half my commute and I don't know how it works without internet. The other thing is, I mostly play wanna play Pokemon. I tried Black or White on an emulator years ago and stopped before the Elite 4, I believe. That is the most recent game I've played. I want to try to play as many of them as possible. Would 3DS be my best option? Is there any way to buy the older ones and play them on 3DS? I know modding is an option and I dont mind trying that as well. Can Switch be modded to play them?

Based on a super successful event we've been hosting on [our partnered Discord server](http://www.discord.gg/pokemon), we're back with another round of **Mystery 'Mon Mondays!!** Much like the popular TV show commercial break special, *Who's That Pokémon?*, it will be your job to tell us the mystery Pokémon... BUT WITH A TWIST!

Every Monday morning we'll post a cropped section of a Pokémon. Here are the rules:

* The cropped section will be from an official rendering of the Pokémon. This could be Sugimori art, Dream World art, a sprite, TCG art, or any other piece of official art.
* The cropped section will have a filter applied to it to distort it just a bit. This filter may alter the color just a *slight* bit, but we don't mess with stuff like the rotation or saturation.
* The Pokémon may or may not be shiny. If it's shiny, you will need to specify that in your guess.
* If the Pokémon has multiple forms, you will need to specify the form in your guess.
* At the end of the day we'll award users who guess correctly one point on our scoreboard.
* Once you've submitted a guess for the week's picture, you cannot submit a second one.
* **Users with 5 correct guesses will earn themselves a nifty ball-flair**

## Submit your guess as a one word answer [in this Direct Message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Mystery-Mon&amp;subject=Mystery+%27Mon+%2334)

Please note that we've been informed that there have been some issues with the bot not working right. We hope to have these issues fixed soon, but we'll also be checking PMs sent to the /u/Mystery-Mon account in the meantime. Once the bot's fixed, we'll also recheck past weeks' entries to make sure we've got them all counted correctly!

*Without further ado,*

They may even appear again due to Let's Go promotions, or they may not.

Oddly enough, the 4 previous female companions either haven't had cameos in a long time or never got a cameo. Look:

May: Her last appearance aired in 2008, exactly 10 years ago. During ORAS they decided not to bring her back for XY, so she hasn't been seen (not counting stuff like flashbacks or Movie 20 ending), in a decade.

Dawn: Her last appearance was 2012. Not quite as long ago, but coming up on 6 years now. Even if there are DP remakes in the next few years, I don't know if she will appear if May didn't.

Iris: Never got a cameo. She hasn't appeared since 2013, she got one special after she left showing her in Johto meeting Clair, but never returned in the main series for a visit

Serena: Of course the main girl who just left the series and kissed Ash. Many figure the reason she won't appear in SM is her character and interactions with Ash won't fit the tone of SM since XY was so different. In fact Serena may actually be turned off by how silly Ash is in SM, although I imagine Serena's character would be altered too. So I don't expect her this series.

Also, as a particular challenge, as you can only choose 3 to take in to battle online, I wanted to do it in 3 pokémon... So here goes...

Nidoking - earthquake, rockslide, poison jab and brick break
Froslass - ice beam, shadow ball, psychic, wake up slap
Trevenant - Wood hammer, phantom force, x-scissor and dark pulse.

I'll be honest, I did this last night on a piece of paper, now I don't have the paper, so if these moves don't cover every type, that's cause I've got a move wrong.

Now all I need are held items. To make most use out of these, I've discounted held items that boost a move type and would prefer items of a stat boosting nature as this would then apply through the whole match, regardless of the move I use, such as increased accuracy or increased special moves... Any suggestions? With justification aswell please.

For reference, I will be hatching these from eggs and trading to ultra moon to use from the beginning of the story.

Have a limited edition flair, on us!","Something momentous happened ten years ago this week. A new place was created. A home on the internet for Pokemon fans of all types.   

Over time, the sub has moved from its humble beginnings as a home for lovers of fanart, competetive players, and collectors who Gotta Catch 'Em All, to become a modern titan of Pokemon featuring people who want to perpetually debate which region is the best, which is the best starter pokemon, or whether or not Serena should go to Alola.  (With a few bits of fanart along the way.)

*****

**/r/Pokemon turns 10 years old this week!** In that time, we've built one of the largest, most active Pokemon communities around, bringing together fans from all walks of the franchise to create a million-strong subreddit of artists, competitors and collectors. We've got a few things planned to celebrate—read on below!

*****

/r/pokemon was created by the now-inactive /u/slashninja in 2008. It grew slowly for the first half decade of its life, and only got halfway to its current size in 2016. In the last few years, though, the sub has exploded, as has the amount of original contribution to it. If you like, **take a look back at our history via [this wiki page,](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/wiki/million_sub_banner)** which showcases some of the most memorable events and contributions of the last ten years.

*****

**To celebrate the decade, we're going to be offering a [limited-time, exclusive flair](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/475365502940872705/485570487154507786/unknown.png)!** This flair will appear [to the right of your username](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/elp_p6lwMcLayqkLShU57Qc4Hmsn9YPIhkREVgY-WNQ/https/i.imgur.com/yui3R4Q.png) when you post on the sub. If you visit the sub during this event and get it, the flair will remain by your name after the week ends, but it won't be available for anybody else to add—it will be a lasting reminder that you were around to help the sub celebrate this special time.

To receive this flair, you need to do several things, the first of which many of you will have already done:

1) Subscribe to the /r/pokemon subreddit.

2A) If you have not previously set up your flair, use [this link](https://rpokemon.github.io/#flair) to set up your base flair on the sub.

2B) If you already have your flair set up, use [the same link](https://rpokemon.github.io/#flair).  Just select your flair pokemon and text again, even the same as you already have, and submit.

The flair bot will, as part of setting or resetting your flair, give you the anniversary flair.  **Warning.  This does not work on the Reddit App, only on Desktop mode browsers.**


*****

The second part of the celebration will be revealed at a later point in time.

It feels like no matter what happens, no matter how good a game is, this entire community will only ever focus on the negative aspects of a game, and not for one second look at the positives.

It's been this way since Gen 6.  ""There's too little story!""  ""Now there's too much story!""  ""They're too easy!""  ""Now they're too hard!""  ""The characters are boring!""  ""Now they're spend too much time with the characters!""  ""Just give us Hoenn remakes already!""  ""Why did they remake the worst region?!""  ""Mega Evolutions ruined the series!""  ""Z-Moves ruined the series!""  I have this overwhelming feeling that if Gen 8 comes with Gen 4 remakes, all of you would still find enough of a reason to complain about it.

If I were a Gamefreak executive, I'd be ready to give up at this point.  Since it wouldn't matter what I come up with, it would just get thrown back in my face and called terrible, followed immediately by demands for the next game.

I miss when this fanbase actually acted as a fanbase.  Back when we were united in all things Pokemon.  Back when we talked about what we love about the games, instead of what we despise.  I just want to express my love of OR/AS and US/UM, but I can't, because everywhere I look, I see people treating them as trash.

It's one thing for a fanbase to be constantly at war with each other.  But when an entire fanbase is united in HATING the very thing they're supposed to be fans of, then you know there's a very serious problem.

I love Pokemon, I truly do.  It is an irreplaceable part of my life.  Some of the happiest moments of my life were spent catching, training, and battling.

Does everything have to be competitive and challenging nowadays or else it’s not worth it? This backlash makes me think that this fandom might be gatekeeping a little bit...

But I just wanted to get an answer to that question without running into big spoilers.     

So I beat Pokemon Yellow, Silver, Emerald, Y and Omega Ruby. Loved them all, and was looking forward to playing through Sun&amp;Moon, but then some real life stuff happened, and I kinda forgot about them. Recently I heard that their enhanced versions came out and decided to finally grab one.    

This time I decided to play Pokemon it in a new way. Instead of looking up every new pokemon beforehand and carefully planning my party, I just kinda discover everything on my own, and it's been pretty fun so far...    

...in those rare moments the game would actually LET me discover stuff on my own. I feel like every 2 minutes I'm being interrupted by a new cutscene, or a meaningless dialogue with your ""rival"", or a lengthy explanation of something, etc. Everything feels so dragged out, the simple animations of characters waving at each other take like 5 seconds where just 1 would be enough. I feel like I'm never allowed to be left alone to be on my own and this instantly kills all joy I find in this game. Initially this made me drop the game for a couple of months, and when I got back to it, I managed to finally get through the first isle, thinking that maybe it will be not so tedious after that. But so far it feels like it's nothing changed...    

For the record, I have nothing against plot and cutscenes in video games. On the contrary, I tend to find games with them more enjoyable. But in this case, it just breaks the flow of the game in the most terrrible way...   

So I wanted to ask, is this something that happens throughout the entire game? Even on isles 2, 3 and 4? Because if so, I really don't think I can keep playing through the game like this. Does anyone else feel this way or is this just my problem?

By far I'd pick double battles. The game is balanced around them, imo they're way more fun (with 8 attack/defensive combinations instead of 2) and they are way faster throughout the game.

The only slightly hairy, i admit, would be that even if you have one pokemon left you'd have to port to the pokemon center or else you could avoid plenty of trainer battles, but they could just make it so you only fight with one pokemon.

I also think it would be helpful if you are underleveled or a gym leader has one tough pokemon you can still chip away. This is one of my problems with USUM was that all the totem pokemon where stronger and faster so many of them just one shot your pokemon until you revived your one pokemon with a type advantage.

It would be really cool to do the final champion match be against two rivals or something in a double battle as well.

The stated reason is to prevent easy cloning of Pokemon. A lot of criticism has been directed at Game Freak for this (it was their decision and not Nintendo's) but I wanted to be constructive and try to come up with a way they could still include cloud saves.

**What's the problem with cloud saves in Pokemon?** It's pretty simple: back up your save, trade some Pokemon and items away, then restore your save, restoring (and thus duplicating) your Pokemon.

**Can't they just force a backup when you do any trade?** Not when you are offline. This is important because local (offline) trading has been a central feature of Pokemon since the beginning. And since the Switch is portable, and has no cellular capabilities, requiring players to connect to the internet to do local trades would be foolish.

**How about, once you try to restore your save, it forces a backup?** That won't work if you delete your save data before reconnecting. Then there would be nothing to back up.

**Hackers will clone anyway. Who cares about them?** This isn't about hackers. They have easier ways of cloning than messing with save backups. This is about preventing regular people, with unmodified Switch hardware and unmodified game data, from easily cloning. If one person can get their hands on a shiny legendary, or a limited time mythical, they can clone and then trade with their friends, and each of them can clone it more. 

**Will regular people even know how to do this?** It's a simple extension of what we've been doing already. Saving before some event and resetting is a common practice in Pokemon, even among casual players. Regardless, people will spread information about this exploit online (probably in the form of clickbait videos), so it will be hard to be ignorant.

**How come other games can implement cloud saves and still trade items?** Because they are always online. If you are always online, every action can be synced to and verified by a dedicated server.

I have an idea that is more punitive than preventative. If the player deletes their save on purpose, the game should also delete the backup once the console reconnects to the internet. If the save is lost without being deleted (for example if their console is lost or their save is corrupted) then it should restore as normal.",,9epk7n,,0,,false,1540104196,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9epk7n/no_cloud_saves_for_pokemonis_there_a_solution/,,,false,Discussion,

Unova, Kalos and Alola all were very linear, with almost no places on the map that loop back or connect to each other. While Unova, and to a lesser extent Kalos, had some cool dungeons and other extra places to explore, has Alola almost none of that (Resolution Cave is even a rehash of Terminus Cave), and has waypoints and lots of roadblocks to make exploration even more redundant.

I am now playing a hack of FireRed that keeps the map intact, and I love how open-ended Kanto is. Many cities and towns are pretty close to each other and interconnected, mostly because of Saffron City, which functions as a central 'crossroads city'. Hoenn also had this in Mauville City, which made it easier and less time consuming to traverse the region until you got Fly. 

But in Kanto, you could do many things in a different order and even skip some things, for example you can skip Lt. Surge's gym, and you have a choice of whether to tackle the Pokemon Tower, Erika's gym or the Rocket Hideout first. If you do some exploring in Celadon City, you can even get the Fly HM and Psychic TM before doing all of the things I mentioned before. Both Fly and Psychic are great moves to use against Team Rocket and Erika's Pokemon. In Sinnoh you also had a choice of entering Pastoria City through Route 212, or through Route 214.

I can only hope Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee will keep Kanto's linear map design.

TLDR; The regions from Gen I-IV were all more open-ended and fun to explore, while it became more boring and linear after that, especially Alola.",,9eq1uj,,0,,false,1540104409,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,3-16 unovaflair 609,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9eq1uj/region_design_in_the_pokemon_games/,,,false,Discussion,

Johto/Hoenn/etc,"I'm interested in getting Let's Go when it releases and already see a list of things I like and don't like about it! Either way, it seems like it will be a decent game!

  
I think I read someone else dropping this idea of \*""Let's go to Hoenn!""\*but I would love it if we eventually continue this franchise with future Let's Go titles that allows you to take your Pokepartner to different regions! They could do it as DLC or full releases. 

I feel like Gamefreak probably won't be surprising me \*\*too\*\* much but I would love it if the Let's Go series was more of a stealth-reboot for them rather than just a side game made to reflect the old ones for a different audience. They have the opportunity now to really sell the idea of pokemon to us again with their new technology and be free from the trappings of their game's previous traditions (Random encounters, battle system, similar formula, having to separate releases by game cartridges meaning they need to balance around new players picking it up). Really make us feel like trainers traveling with our partners, challenging opponents, raising our pokemon and growing with them vs the current model of ""catch as many as you can and move on to the next batch + global level reset"". 

With the removal of wild pokemon battles, we wouldn't even have to start at level 1, losing all of our pokemon, over and over again (like Metroid/Megaman). In DLC, we could just keep rolling forward, facing more experienced enemies in larger regions! With some focus, I feel like this series could feel more ""Pokemon"" than the \*main-line\* series and maybe all future expansions can start from this base Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu game (future regions can still have exclusive pokemon based on your partner, meaning you don't have to have Silver/Gold editions).   


Anyway, that is just my hope for the series! The thought came to me recently and I was curious where you all think this Side series may be heading to - is this a one off thing? Will they continue it? Will it eventually compete with the main series? If the Let's Go series really does continue to expand and allow you to carry your character/partner through several different regions, do you see yourself viewing it higher/more mainstream than the main games, themselves?

Dragon: 

Blazing Wing - Hits the opponent with the user's flaming wing (power 75, 10% chance of burn)    
Vicious Rake - Scrawls the opponent with sharp claws (power 120, 10% chance of flinch)    
Wyvern Fire - Burns the opponent with fiery breath (power 100, 20% chance of burn)    

Dark:

Underhand Strike - Strikes the opponent from below, if this move goes second, it disorients the opponent and lowers its accuracy by 1 (power 70)

Fighting:

Multi Kick: Like Double/Triple Kick but can hit up to 5 times, and each consecutive hit is stronger (power 10 x hit number, no SFX)    

Ghost:

Zombify: Lowers opponent's speed by 2, may cause confusion or sleep (5% each)

Ice:

Quickfreeze: Same priority as Quick Attack, strikes with a cold blast (power 45, special move)    
Zero Degrees: The icy cousin of Will O' Wisp, Thunder Wave, Toxic and Sing (status move, guaranteed freeze, 30% accuracy)    

Steel:

Jagged Edge: Cuts the opponent with a jagged metal edge (physical move, power 70, 10% chance of poison)    
Ninja Strike: Similar to Dig (power 80)
Oxidize: The Steel-type equivalent of poisoning, only works on other Steel types, gives them the Rust status (identical to Poison except for name and appearance) (status move)    
Upgrade: Increases Attack and Defence by 1 each (status move)    
Zigzag Cut: Cuts the opponent with a zigzagged edge (like a saw blade) (physical move, 100 power, no SFX)    ",,9jsh21,,0,,false,1540189802,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jsh21/madeup_pokémon_moves/,,,false,Discussion,

Milk Drink would be of this type, as would a bunch of other new moves, usually to heal yourself or your team, or attack the enemy with food. Some of these attacks have a chance of poison.

Resists: Fire (cooking food doesn't usually ruin it), Ice (freezing food is usually ok), Food (combining food with other food just makes meals), Dark (darkness won't do food any harm)

Immune to: Ghost (ghosts can't interact with food)

Strong against: Electric (ever spilled a drink on your computer?), Steel (similar reasons to Electric)

Not very effective: Fire, Ice, Water, Food

1. Has to be caught within ultra sun, no events (if they still go on) or trading.

After hearing these I began to wonder why people felt that way, including myself. Could it be the small number of new pokemon with a lot of ""remixes"" on older mons(Megas and Alolan forms)? Could it be the strangely high amount of single evo pokemon with weird snowflakey typings[you look at this and tell me ""grass / ghost type""](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/2f/781Dhelmise.png). Could it be the more handholdy nature of the game with the exp share autoleveling everyone and trainers usually having 1 pokemon, making the game feel like it plays itself? Could it be the lack of evolutions to past pokemon like in Gens 2 and 4? Is it the more manic circus house meta with weird looking pokemon with unbalanced stats? Could it be the lack of spinoffs and side games that were prevelant in Gens 3-5?

I'm not here to discount any of those, but I believe I found something bigger as to why the last few gens feel different: **the artstyle has gradually shifted with the series, starting in Gen 4 and becoming most noticeable in Gen 6.**

Here me out here.

The older pokemon have a more mundane, grotesque, and ""realistic"" style to them, while newer pokemon are more cartoony and stylized. Take a look at [Growlithe](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/3/3d/058Growlithe.png/600px-058Growlithe.png) vs [Lillipup](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/7/7e/506Lillipup.png/1200px-506Lillipup.png)(no hate to either they were my fav pokemons in each gen). They both have similar designs, but take a closer look at the styles they are drawn in. Growlithe has more realistic proportions to an irl dog, it's got more spiky fur and rough lines in it's art. Meanwhile, Lillipup is much more rounded, having almost entirely round bobs of fur, along with a disproportionately giant head and ears.

After doing some digging around, I've found that the pokemon designs for Gens 1-3 all looked like this, with being around Gen 4 that the style started to shift, with pokemon like Floatzel, Pachirisu, Shinx, the starters especially sharing this style. But people always group gen 4-5 in with 1-3, because with the spritework, they still tried to capture the pokemon in more realistic depictions.

Take a look at [Gen 3 Eevee](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/f8/Spr_3r_133.png), [Gen 4 Eevee](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/28/Spr_4h_133.png), [Gen 6 Eevee](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/d/d2/Spr_6x_133.png), and [Eevee's official artwork](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/e/e2/133Eevee.png/250px-133Eevee.png). With the jump to 3d, pokemon had to change their style to fit the new models instead of the sprites, giving everyone the more cartoony style. For older pokemon like Eevee, this didn't really fit well, it's head and fur suddenly are disproportionately large, and it just has this blank stare on it's face throughout the game. The change in art form made the previous change in art style noticeable, and made the next 2 gens of pokemon feel off compared to the past. This is also probably why people say Mystery Dungeon Gates to Infinty doesn't look like the old Mystery Dungeon games, the 3d ness.

How can they fix this? They could return to spritework a la Sonic Mania in gen 8, albeit unlikely, they would be able to sprite all the pokemon in the older style. More likely is they could find some middle ground art style, making the new pokemon look like the older ones for the Switch games, which is more likely. Although honestly I doubt any attempt to change the art style will happen, especially after Lets Go intensified the chibi and cartoony art style and the SM anime embraced it.

Tldr: Pokemon had a subtle shift in design and art styles in gen 4, and once the art style changed in Gen 6 with 3d models to reflect this, it made the latest 2 generations feel different from the first 5.",,9jz3ew,,0,,false,1540192887,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,1-25 kantoflair 59,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jz3ew/analysis_why_gens_67_feel_different_from_gens_15/,,Gen 4 Master Race,false,Discussion,

Probably due to getting older and the inability to afford the 3DS.

Until a few months ago when I came across a Pokemon stream and my interest in the series reignited. So I went out and purchased what I thought was the most up to date console for pokemon games the 2DSXL and I have to say I love this console. I also purchased a game from each new gen (Pokemon X, Alpha Sapphire and Ultra sun). All of these games were fun and had their own positives and negatives (my favourite being Alpha Sapphire ). 

But I recently found out after researching upcoming and new Pokemon Games; that no more games will be released for the 3DS and that the newest game to release (Let's go Pickachu and Eevee) will be released in November. At first I didn't really care because the things i've read about the new games seem off putting, but after watching some gameplay trailers the games looks absolutely amazing. And now I feel silly as I could've done a bit of research beforehand and waited until LGPE to get a switch instead of a 3DS.

So now what I wanted to ask is whether or not it'll benefit me to sell on my 2DSXL and games and put it towards preordering the LGPE switch bundle and be there for all the hype? Or wait until the games been out for a while and get it either when the hype has died down or when the next gen of games are released?

TLDR: Purchased 2DSXL recently without realising no more pokemon games for it, wish I done research and waited for the switch and LGPE. Should I sell 2DSXL and games to get switch LGPE bundle?",,9jzjrt,,0,,false,1540193084,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jzjrt/unsure_what_to_do/,,,false,Discussion,

Canonically, are there any non-legendary Pokemon besides Pikachu who are so consistently impressive in battle? Obviously Team Rocket (JJM) usually lose but the Wob actually does really well regardless. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I just saw the episode ""Same Old Song and Dance"" (243) and in one of the battles Wobuffet takes down Phanphy, Poliwhirl, and Jigglypuff (another very strong battler) with his Counter attacks, enabling Team Rocket to get away. Or in the episode, ""Wayward Wobuffet"" Wob easily dispatches Goneff's Golem with his counter attack, and Golem's have been shown at times to be strong physical battlers. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Now I know that in the video games Wobuffet is considered an Uber and one of the strongest battlers (some would say he is extremely unfair because of his Shadow Tag ability) but how strong actually is Jessie's Wobuffet compared to other Pokemon in the anime?  (Also bonus question, how formidable would Jessie actually have been if the writers let her use Wobuffet in battle more often?)

I looked back at my old playthroughs of previous Pokemon titles and I remember I would always try to go over the limit because everything just looked cool, but it started to get rough and I would end up training only 6. I currently have 7 Pokemon with me and it will only grow as I progress further since I have a lot of favorites. I’m afraid it’ll start to get tedious even with the exp share on and I’ll have to stick with 6. 

My question is, how does one stick with 6 Pokemon when there’s a lot to choose from? I always want to use all of my favorites (though I restrict it to Pokemon from that specific region to make it easier) and end up getting overwhelmed. I haven’t reached that point yet but I’ve always had this problem with Pokemon in the past and now the Let’s Go games are coming out soon. I happen to love a lot of Pokemon from Kanto so I know I’ll find it hard to stick with 6 yet again... Anyways, just rambling here haha. Pokemon’s one of my favorite franchises—I just feel I make it appear harder than it should which isn’t exactly fun.

Which, as a meltan fan, makes me upset, but you have to realize something first. 

This is 1 pokemon we are getting. ***1***. In past games we get at least a good 70, with our best haul being 156 from Black and white (which was controversial in its own way). But with this being said, you either love 100% of the 
new pokemon, or hate 100% of the new pokemon. Along with that, our tried and true 151 are... kinda rusty. Sure we all have 5 or 6 we love. But its hard to get into these games with only a few, 1 new pokemon, and 1 sealed slot (pikachu/eevee).

I think if GF wanted to make a pokemon go based game as a remake of pokemon yellow, they should have stated it this way. They claim new story lines and features and new pokemon and... its just not true. 

So what wouldve made the remake easier to buy? Lets keep pokemon go mechanics intact. 

*add back old pokemon to the mix. Its been 20 years, its hard going back to the same old 151. Even if they were obtainable post game, itd bring in more fans.

*add new features. Sure, the pokemon walker system is back, but i feel like that isnt enough to get people riled up to buy. ORAS brought in new ways to use the Dexnav, as well as the soar ability, mirage islands, and other ways to reimagine the classics. Right now PGPE is at a C level for this which... isnt great.

But I've seen a lot of people (myself included) wondering...why is it *Mythical*? What makes it a Legendary, let alone a dangerous one.

But it clicked when I read its ""additional information"". It's curious, corrodes and absorbs metal and produces electricity, and it's liquid metal. These details are what made it click for me.

It's [Grey Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Goo). It's a nanomachine ""organism"" (or a group of them, rather) that consumes machinery, electronics, etc. to feed itself. Depending on the story, there can be multiple reasons for this. Sometimes it's to self-replicate, sometimes it's a sinister alien weapon meant to disarm by devouring every last bit of technology. Sometimes it's to learn and grow.

But the general concept is, it does what it does ceaselessly; it corrodes and absorbs metal to grow or consume. I'm wondering...maybe THIS is why it's Mythical. Perhaps even why it's rumored to star in the new movie alongside Mewtwo? ""Science gone wrong"" might be a theme between the two; Meltan is able to absorb and adapt technology, perhaps growing in power...perhaps growing in power *too much*? Who knows!

Anyway I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts on the idea!! For me it clicked straight away, but I'd like to see what everyone else thinks of this theory!",,9iy0bw,,0,,false,1540175575,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-8 kantoflair 9,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9iy0bw/meltan_a_scifi_creature_concept/,,,false,Discussion,

I'm asking for a project I want to do.  I'm currently compiling a list of Pokemon where I think it would be hard for them to naturally evolve , and going to see if I can't find an explanation for them.

This obviously disappointed a lot of fans and sort of split the community in half. At first this seemed extremely frustrating because i personally did not think sun and moon and usum were as good as previous titles. I was anxiously waiting for the next installment to spend my time in. With the lets go series, i was immediately disappointed for how not that different it was to sun and moon visually. It felt like the same game in 1080p almost, which worried me.

I said earlier that the community was split in half with the reveal of the lets go series. I think that this is the best thing thats happened to pokemon in years. Ever since pokemon was climbing to its peak during the D/P generation, i feel every game was getting more and more hand holdy and linear, to appease newer fans who would understandably get overwhelmed with everything to do in the games. From gamefreaks perspective, im sure they hear the community complain that the games are getting easier and less challenging, but their hands are tied. They were trying extremely hard to find a balance between catering to both types of players. This obviously is not easy to do since a lot of the changes to the newer games are very polarizing. With the lets go series, i sincerely hope gamefreak caters to each type of fan on each game.

Why do gamefreak need to nail the 2019 title? This game will have had 4 years of development if it is released on schedule. For most games this is plenty of time. But im sure gamefreak are trying their best to get all the pokemon to look right on the new engine. Hundreds of unique models will take time to get right, but im confident they will make the pokemon look fantastic.

The word ""ultimate"" is being used so many times with ninendo swich games. Smash, Monster hunter, and even though the word isn't used in these titles, many consider them to be he ultimate rendition of their respective IPs; BotW, Odyssey, Mario Kart, and Mario Party. Continuing with this trend, i can safely assume that the next pokemon game will be an ultimate version.

In the last decade of games, ive spent most of my hours on Platinum (600 ish). This was simply because the postgame felt rich, the region felt like my home, and the characters had deep narratives based around them. On the other end of the spectrum, theres USUM, which i stopped playing as soon as i caught all the ultra beasts, (barely 150). Simply because the narrative was carrying the game so hard for the entire story then just ends. The region just felt empty and one dimensional to me by then.

If the next title will truly be an ultimate version, it should truly have infinite replay value. At first this seems ambitious, but if any game can do this, it would and should be a pokemon game. The first thing that comes to mind, is to add DLC support to the game. Things like new story instances, new maps, even new pokemon! To be honest im sick and tired of the events we keep getting, especially those involving mythicals. i dont want the regions mythical pokemon to be given out in an event. What if there was a proper story arc we could experience, like in HGSS! where we would have to battle new characters, and visit new worlds! This would truly make mythicals feel special, and have an actual connection to your character.

The second thing, is to balance the game with patches within the first few months of release. It really sucks that certain pokemon are banned in pro tournaments for a whole generation because theyre imbalanced. Gamefreak can tweak things here and there and it would result in a more fun and enjoyable game for the professionals.

Third, make the online interface GOOD PLEASE. Gamefreak, you've been trying different renditions of the online system for over 10 years, please for gods sake nail it this time. Online minigames, tournaments, a transparent ranking/elo system for online battles, LFP interface for doubles/triples, even pokemon contests! theres too much potential here!

Fourth point, truly get rid of HMs, and rework the ride pager. Treat ride pager pokemon like mounts, each with pros and cons to them. And add some depth to them via leveling them up to be more effective in what they do. IE Tauros could have a stamina bar and cant break harder rocks unless you level it up with perks. Give players a post game ride pokemon like latias/latios in oras where we can fly around at crazy speeds. Or a ride pokemon that unlocks a bunch of new areas that cant be unlocked without it. Maybe a ground type pokemon to explore underground tunnels and caves.

Fifth and final point, look at pokken tournaments art style [https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://switchplayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017091720362200-5A6F3157C944341CDE279FD85822A3AD.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://switchplayer.net/2017/09/18/pokken-tournament-dx-review/&amp;h=720&amp;w=1280&amp;tbnid=wTxQafV-2Pu90M&amp;tbnh=168&amp;tbnw=300&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=EFpLIG6KXRdp5M](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://switchplayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017091720362200-5A6F3157C944341CDE279FD85822A3AD.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://switchplayer.net/2017/09/18/pokken-tournament-dx-review/&amp;h=720&amp;w=1280&amp;tbnid=wTxQafV-2Pu90M&amp;tbnh=168&amp;tbnw=300&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=EFpLIG6KXRdp5M), and copy it.

**Topic: Creative ways of promoting new Pokémon!**

This last week, The Pokémon Company along with Niantic revealed a [new Pokémon](https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/new-pokemon/) in an unconventional manner by having it (or rather, Dittos disguised as the new Pokémon) appear unannounced, in the wild, in Pokémon GO!

And it has something to do with that truck.

Yes, that truck in Vermilion City.

So the player first enters Vermilion City and sees that truck, but it is surrounded by different NPCs. Curious, you approached one of the NPC and they say,

""My Uncle works for Game Freak and has told me that there was something mysterious about this truck!""

Another one says, ""My neighbor told me a Pokemon is hiding under this truck!""

Another one says, ""I have never seen this truck driven by anyone, and it has been parked here for years without accumulating a single fleck of dust!""

The NPCs are standing so coincidentally perfect that it is impossible to interact with the truck. What about interacting it from the water? Nope. There are two trainers each riding a Lapras also blocking the player from interacting with the truck.

As there is nothing to do with the truck, and you cannot force anyone to leave, you continue on your journey.

...

After beating the Elite Four, you are contacted by Professor Oak about that truck and you return to Vermilion City. There, Oak gives you a special machine detecting Pokemon and instructs you to bend under and investigate the truck. The game will then enter into a look-around mode (just like finding the Mimikyu Acerola's Trial in Pokemon SM / USUM), and you try to spot something unusual.

You see a strange shiny nut lodged under the side of the truck, and using the machine Oak gave you, there is a reaction! A single eyeball appeared inside the nut and you feel the whole truck starting to turn into jelly, you quickly jump back out and then you witness the entire truck transforming into...

Meltan!!

Cue some cool music and the encounter starts immediately (Deoxys style in Pokemon ORAS), defeat it, and then catch it when its HP reaches 0.

Oak mutters some lore/scientific stuff/congrats/""I knew something was dodgy about that truck"" stuff and then walks off.

So, here's just my take on how to find Meltan in game. Obviously this is just a speculation thread and is not to be taken seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

So I grew up with the Pokémon animated show, but I never played any games. I got a Switch last year and am in love. I know people grumble a lot, but Let's Go looks like a hell of a lot of fun to me (and something I can play with my kids). 

&amp;#x200B;

But, since I'm new to this whole genre, what stuff do I need to know? Which Pokémon rock, which don't? Should I try my mind at Pokémon Go (the whole AR thing looks like a put-off, but it seems it ties in to Let's Go)? People seem to complain about no IV's or EV's and I have no bloody idea what that means.

With so many interpretations of Pokemon out there, each one is bound to make someone blindly angry. Which spin off title do you dislike for personal, subjective reasons yet can respect that it is probably a good game in most people's eyes.

Upon further thinking, I think I have two. First one being Baffle Revolution for the Wii. I can respect that, objectively, it is a fine game. It provides so many randomly generated battle formats and such that it truly feels like Battle Frontier meets Pokemon Stadium (and, controversial opinion, i think it, objectively out classes both Emerald's Frontier and the two Stadium titles once you remove nostalgia). However, I was livid that the next big 3D console spin off was NOT in style of Colosseum and XD. I adored those games and Colosseum even had gameplay modes that resembled Stadium 1 and 2. So it wasn't an insane idea to be mad at this game for not having ANY story mode at all. 

A more recent game that has pissed me off is Detective Pikachu. This is more on principle. Pokemon spent years and years developing this title. They could have out sourced someone to make a new PMD. A new Ranger. A new Conquest. Or even a new idea. But no: in the generation where we (debateably) reached the most intricate story telling for Pokemon thus far, even going as far as to make the MULTIVERSE canon while on a console that can handle even a 3D Mario title...we get essentially a point and click adventure with gameplay a step above a dating simulator. I was livid that this time and energy didn't go into something with more gameplay and entertainment value.

But if it's a ditto remake, shouldn't it be able to breed with other legendaries/mythicals (I consider them the same but whatever)? Mainly the Ultra Beasts? Cause think about it, the Ultra Beasts SHOULD be able to breed, from usum to every new generation cause there's literally an infinite number of them thanks to the wormholes. So why can't they breed? Mainly cause the Pokemon world sees them as genderless do to them being aliens from other dimensions. Therefore, WE have no idea what their genders are but THEY do. 
So, what if Meltan was the answer to this? Cause it seems like a chemically altered Ditto (even more so than Ditto). This alteration had to have happen for a reason, perhaps for breeding with the (relatively) newly discovered ultra beasts.

Meltan however is interesting as well as it did get data-mine we only knew about the model. That's it.

What if they expanded the whole concept of Rainbow Rocket to all of Alola with each leader taking an island for themselves (Maxie and Archie could share). So Giovanni would still have Aether Paradise, I'd give Maxie and Archie Akala Island simply because it has a volcano and sort of a water area (or at least a water area dedicated enough for a trial captain). 

Lysandre would probably get Ula' Ula Island because there does seem to be a theme of royalty, clinging to the old ways (with Malie city being based on a more older version of Japan, in the same vein as Ecruteak in Johto) and examples of humans trying to tarnish the beauty of the region with modern stuff only for Pokemon to lash out (The abandoned megamart). Plus, the two captains deal with electric and ghost types, which make up a fair amount of the Kalos Pokemon.

Cyrus would get Poni Island because it's the most empty and uncivilized part of the region, with the exception of Seafolk Village, the rest is just wildlands and canyons, plus, it's near one of the Altars which can be used as an entrance to Ultra Space, seems kind of fitting.

Ghetsis would get Melemele Island for a few reasons, one is that it's the island where Guzma grew up so there's an element of child abuse that we know of, it also works since if we're including the scene where he attacks Lillie, it would be a good idea for her to be on the island, maybe with Kukui. You could also have him threathen/harm the PC's mother, at least to give better justification for why it suddenly mentions their Pokemon getting insanely furious. Plus, it's the only island where the Tapu has greater plot relevance and you'd know Ghetsis would want a Pokemon that powerful and revered.

You probably would have to travel to each island and beat them in order to get something that would allow you to reach Giovanni. In my mind, each island would have grunts relative to the leader that's controlling it but I doubt that could happen so just keeping them as RR grunts is fine but yeah, I'd kind of like to go through the islands again, searching for these leaders and learning about Giovanni's plan piece by piece that way.",,9jeqkh,,0,,false,1540183377,false,spoiler,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jeqkh/what_if_giovanni_had_taken_his_plans_further_in/,,,false,Discussion,

The Problem with Abra


During my first play through of red, I picked up an abra on nugget Bridge ; At that point I knew this was going to be my Charmander's main battle companion and competition.


Anyhoo, as pkmn red progressed, my newly evolved kadabra slayed anything and everything put in front of it, due to its high 'special' value.


Clearly, the devs at game freak saw fit for a 'special' stat nerf and decided it was easiest put into action via a 'sp def' and 'sp att' sub categories.


Moreover, I began my epic journey in pokemon ruby with the swampert devolution (the name of which escapes me) and was looking for a battle companion; I was trying to follow on from my previous success in ruby with a strong two-stack to wreck the competition.


Fast forward to Granite cave in my ruby playthrough, as soon as I walk in what appears? An abra no less. Sick. If red was anything to go by I should be able to slay with this abra and eventually kadabra.


I WAS SO WRONG. Abra and kadabra were NERFED TO FUCK and my level 55 kadabra was all but useless in the elite four battles in ruby. He proved to be the definition of glass cannon, due to his extremely low defence stat.


As well as this, it seemed to me that my kadabra's main attacks (psychic and psybeam) were completely useless for most of the game, since every other member of team magma seemed to have a mightyena.
20% of my game time seemed to be


*kadabra used psychic*

I mentioned a fusion gimmick I came up with long ago, but some don't want it to happen cause it's blatant they don't trust GF to make good designs with that, as well, they want it to stick with legendaries. But then someone brought up the next best thing, crossbreeding.  In all honesty that makes the most sense. Animals in the real world are crossbred all the time to make new versions of animals. Pokemon can do the same. However, to make things easier for the developers, how about they only make a few compatible pokemon for crossbreeding and build up the number as time passes. So as an example, take a Lucario and a Zoroark.  You breed them and you have a chance to have a crossbred version of a Riolu. This one would be Dark/Fighting and can have a new or same ability as one of the parents (I don't mean it's randomized what ability one pokemon can have from the parents, it'll be a specific parent it'll take from), and it can learn the same egg moves as a normal version, inherit stats. Now I said you'll have a ""chance"" to get the cross version cause I know many would rather have the old version as well with the egg moves and stuff they want, so that way it wouldn't be impossible.

In the early generations of pokemon, mythical pokemon were extremely rare - you'd have to go to IRL events or buy other products in order to get them. This made them really cool and owning one felt like owning a true legend. This, afterall, is why Mythical pokemon were and still are banned from VGC - not everybody can get them.

Generation 3 had Deoxys and Jirachi, who you'd have to go to special islands to capture. These pokemon not only required you to get real world items such as Pokemon Coliseum and Nintendo Event tickets.

Generation 4, on the other hand, introduced mystery gift through wifi, but this was still okay. The mythical pokemon of Gen 4 came alongside special areas, stories, and sidequests that displayed their power and made Sinnoh feel even bigger.

Gens 5-7 are where mythical pokemon began to go down the drain. Most of these mythical pokemon stopped being ""rare"" and were basically just glorified legendaries. Other than Victini, the event distributed ones, which were all through wifi, were basically just handed to you by a pokemon center employee.

Mythical pokemon were beginning to lose their myth.

Enter: Meltan. Meltan wasn't even confirmed as pokemon when we were first finding information about it in Pokemon Go. It blew up pretty quickly, as it was a pokemon with no name, no stats, and just turned into Ditto whenever you caught it. But it existed. Now that Meltan has been 100% confirmed and described, the myth isn't really lost - it's still a really interesting pokemon and interesting story - far more interesting than ""after the update data miners found a new pokemon and then that pokemon is just given to players.""

I'm hoping that Game Freak does more with mythical pokemon come gen 8 - more AR stuff would be cool, but maybe even something like hinting at pokemon through dialogue in the games would be a return to form.

The idea came about from the ingame drink ""Tapu Cocoa"" and I was really sad when the cup wasn't a Tapu Koko shell. So I decided to make a full set if drinking glasses and I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of what to make Tapu Fini's shell into. 
I thought of making it a teapot but that would seem like it's the leader of the Cupus and I don't really want that to be the case, but I also don't want to lose it's form too much to make it a gobstandard mug.
So far, Tapu Koko will be a basic round mug with it's designs, Tapu Bulu will be one of those big tiki cups that are for luaus, and Tapu Lele is going to be a lidded teacup. If anyone has ideas and maybe some reference pics, I'd be eternally grateful.",,9ji2qq,,0,,false,1540184910,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9ji2qq/island_guardian_cups_help/,,,false,Discussion,

&amp;#x200B;

I have started playing Pokeone and Pokemon Revolution online simultaneously. However I am confused as to which should I continue playing. (One of my friend plays pokeone, but I am far into PRO - Lvl 70 pokemon and all) to switch now without good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

While PRO is complete, it doesn't have some features which pokeone does - Same exp gain for all pokemon, whether it's evolved or not, FLYING outside battle. I don't care for 3d battle scenes, they can be text based for all that matters. Also, you get costumes and all just by playing the game (Pokeone). But, PRO has an android client :-/

&amp;#x200B;

So should I

1. Stop playing PRO where I have progressed past 6th Gym Badge and start playing Pokeone where I haven't done anything.
2. Continue playing PRO and get to Pokeone once it's finished/ don't think about Pokeone for now.

So a while back, I wrote a Pokémon fanfiction that delved into stories and ideas that were briefly mentioned in the games, but left mostly unexplained, as well as take some artistic liberties on explaining different aspects of the Pokémon universe. The theory I would like to share is my thoughts on the Pokémon Unown. I know everyone thinks Arceus is the Pokégod of the Pokémon universe, but I propose a different theory: what if Unown was Pokégod? I present my evidence as to why Arceus is not only NOT the Creator, but not even the first Pokémon.

- Most people will argue that the games state it specifically that Arceus is the Creator. They are wrong. The games specifically use the words ""It is said..."" and ""According to legend...""  This means it is not a concrete fact that Arceus is the Creator, that it is merely believed to be.

- Arceus can be caught, and then that's it. It is captured. There is only one, and that is that. What kind of deity can be captured and obeys the whims of a prepubescent child?

- Mew, in my opinion, is the first Pokémon, as while the Pokédex uses the same wording as Arceus when mentioning it contains the DNA of all Pokémon, this statement can be backed up with science. DNA can be observed and analyzed. Arceus creating the world cannot. Mew also learns Transform, shifting into any Pokémon, including Arceus. Arceus cannot.

- Mew can also learn every TM ever, while Arceus cannot.

- The Unown is formed out of letters. English letters, specifically, but a human language nonetheless. It is entirely possible the human language was developed by Unown or simply based on it, rather than Unown being based on human language.

Now I know that it would appear that Mew would be the Pokégod rather than Unown. So why Unown? After all, the Unown are terribly weak, can also be captured, and only have one move: Hidden Power. Well, first of all, Unown are infinite. Using just one Unown in battle would be like using a single hair to fight off an opponent. Even a party of them would barely touch the power they are capable of. Also, the only move they know is Hidden Power, but of course it is. The power of God is always unknown to mortals. Humans cannot begin to fathom the power of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent deity. So yeah, Hidden Power. Finally, the Unown are basically eyes, never blinking, always watching. With an infinite number of Unown/eyes, it's ease to see why they would be omniscient. They can see everything.

TL:DR - Unown is God, Mew was the first Pokémon created by Unown, and Arceus came after Mew, because reasons.",,9hzvwe,,0,,false,1540159635,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9hzvwe/my_pokémon_fan_theory_about_unown/,,,false,Discussion,

Edit: apparently I didn’t actually do a URL link in my original post... oops http://albrechtanalytics.com/stories/2018/contest-pokemon.html

I made a data visualization for the /r/dataisbeautiful monthly contest about Pokémon.  Just wanted to share it with this fine sub in case you all thought it was interesting.

I loved Pokémon growing up......however I haven't done anything with Pokémon since the 2nd generation. It was very interesting to see that the amount of Pokémon out there has basically quadrupled since I last played!

A lot of the other contest submissions were very pointed highlighting one or two aspects of the data, but that's only part of the story. I wanted a visual that incorporated ALL data points on ALL Pokémon, which clustering is ideal for. I also wanted to emphasize the beautiful part of this visual and not necessarily the data. Clustering is good for showing you what things are similar, but doesn't necessarily tell you why they are similar. I made this graphic and loved it because it reminds you just how similar -- and dissimilar -- Pokémon are across all the generations.

My post has 3 visuals. Two of the visuals are just the actually clustering results with one visual having some pokémon pictures located where they correspond to on the clustering while the other version doesn't have the pictures (for a more clean look). The third visual is a very basic tableau interactive scatterplot in case people were curious about where pokémon were located.  There are also x/y coordinates at the bottom of post if you wanted to look for a specific Pokémon.

Personally, I hate leaks. I'm the kind of person that doesn't watch trailers, the type of person who spent over a month dodging star design leaks before Sun and Moon came out, you get the deal. I've been desperately hoping we don't get something like the ESRB leak for Smash Ultimate. But the release of this Pokemon into Go!, this I like. I really like.

I started playing pokemon with Pearl, and I grew up mostly watching generation III games on Youtube. So I've never played the older games, I wasn't even alive when Red and Blue released. But I understand what people talk about when they remember playing the games as a kid, in an age before you get just google anything about a game online, encountering pokemon for the first time. The age of rumors, of Mew under a truck, of being surprised to find out MissingNo was real.

The series has lost that over time. In the modern day, it's not even within an hour of release that the dex (or roster, or whatever, depending on the game) of a new game is all online - it's all to often quite a while before the game even releases. On top of this, we know everything about all these pokemon immediately, too. It's a difficult, albeit not impossible, task to avoid seeing them all before long. 

But with this cute little ditto-nut? It's all just theories, nobody knows what it is, what's it's doing here, where they're going with it. We're not even sure if it's the real design. Sure, usually we spend a few months speculating what they'll evolve the starters into, but it's not the same. This here, this is a real mystery, and I feel it re-kindles something the series has all but lost.

It could be its fluid like body, and eye that is the Pokémon, but not the metal object. I also see that it’s tail looks like some kind of wire stuck into its body.

One thing I really liked about the original Rumble game for Wii is how easy multiplayer is. In every hub area there’s a station to quickly log players in and out, which is really handy when you have 4 siblings (oh, you can also use GameCube controllers instead of Wiimotes)!

Summary: “Dittnut” is a Poke-organism created by the same researchers involved in the Mew cloning experiments. They modeled the creature after a bacteriophage virus as a biological weapon against clone attempts or test subjects that have become too strong/sentient.

____________________________________________

Full “Dittnut” Virus Theory:

I’d offer up an alternative perspective from the (very convincing) celestial/planetary theory centered around Saturn’s Hexagon with regard to “Dittnut”.   I believe the theme might rather be cellular/viral, as suggested in the Zygarde theory.  However, that train of thought might introduce a more complex relationship between “Dittnut” and the Mew/Zygarde families.

As a biologist, my immediate impression was that “Dittnut” seemed to be modeled after a bacteriophage: a virus that parasitizes a bacterium by attaching to, infecting and reproducing inside it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage

The term bacteriophage was derived from ""bacteria"" and the Greek φαγεῖν (phagein), ""to devour"".

____________________________________________

A note on “Dittnut’s” overall appearance:

Like “Dittnut”, a bacteriophage (specifically: Enterobacteria phage T4) has a hexagonal “head” and a lower “body” with short arm- and leg-like appendages, as well as, a sort of hypodermic tail.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage#/media/File%3APhageExterior.svg

This is also the smallest Poke-organism* to date - which is to be expected if modeled after something small enough to infiltrate a bacterium and consume it from the inside-out.

*Referred to as “Poke-organism” because it feels more like a component (e.g. Zygarde Cell/Core) than an actual dex-entry Pokemon...

____________________________________________

A note on “Dittnut’s” tail: 

Once a bacteriophage has attached to the bacterium (some of which look very much like Zygarde Cells), it uses a highly specialized tail to inject its own DNA into the host.

“Dittnut’s” own tail has a very port- or plug-like appearance. It seems like a piece of anatomy that might have a specific function - for example, transferring genetic/computational data.

The tail of the “Dittnut” and the bacteriophage might just have an analogous purpose - infiltrate and destroy its host.

(The tails are represented as red and blue in the normal and shiny sprites, respectively. Red and blue are commonly used in simplified models of DNA to differentiate the two sides of the helix. In addition to those two specific colors, the ends of the tails seemed to splay like a helix in the process of separating.)

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YI3tsmFsrOg

____________________________________________

A note on “Dittnut’s” behavior:

As we have seen with the sudden appearance of a mass “Dittnut” spawn at the end of the Community Day event - it almost appears that there was an OUTBREAK of theses Poke-organisms.

In a bacteriophage outbreak, the phages require a host bacterium (possibly a Pokemon when translated to the “Dittnut” story) to infiltrate and then reproduce. This viral replication behavior dovetails nicely with the transformation/copy/unstable DNA narrative surrounding Mew, Ditto and Mewtwo (some connection to Ditto is already confirmed with today’s events).

____________________________________________

A note on “Dittnut’s” target host:

Each bacteriophage has its own particular host range, the range of bacteria that it can infect. While some phages can only infect one or a few bacterial strains, other phages can infect many species.

“Dittnut” may be a specialist - only capable of infecting Zygarde or Mew/Ditto/Mewtwo families.  And, perhaps, were created to combat/control failed clone attempts or test subjects that got too strong (or became too sentient, as teased at the end of Pokemon: The Story of Us).

Essentially, the theory would manifest in the researchers who carried out the Mew cloning experiments (or similar storyline for Zygarde) waging biological warfare against their own rogue creations.

____________________________________________

Additional random thoughts on “Dittnut” as a bacteriophage:

- Is “Dittnut” a biological or technological virus?
- “Dittnut” vs. Zygarde Cell... does one infect the other?
- Is “Dittnut” a hero or villain? A tool or weapon?
- Is “Dittnut” an original part of the Pokemon Go storyline or more of a Let’s Go/Gen. 8 tie-in?
- Did Pokemon Go’s mobile connectivity lead to the creation of this virus?
- Is there some correlation between “Dittnut” and a story similar to Digimon: The Movie (a viral Digimon outbreak multiplying and consuming  [phage means to eat] data)... “Dittnut’s” design is reminiscent of Keramon and its single-eyed pre-evolutions.
- A Pokemon story set in the mobile space opens up opportunity for more digital/technological cross-over.
- Will the Gen. 8 story focus on a fight to contain some kind of outbreak threatening the Pokemon universe?
- (If this creature was modeled after something Celestial - wouldn’t it be expected to be far larger/more grand? Why have such tiny Pokemon representing the planets?)

Fans are confused and curious about this mysterious pocket monster, I am too in fact. Here I will talk about my thoughts, theory, and explaination for Dittonut's appearence.

Ditto is most commonly referred to as a failed Mew clone. In the secret laboratory where you uncover the truth about Mewtwo, Dittos can be found everywhere, leading theorists to theorize Ditto is a failed Mew clone. This theory is widely accepted among the community.

Most of you should already know where I am going with this. When Dittonut is caught, it is shown to be a plain Ditto, nothing more, nothing less. Nintendo and Niantic both proposed this event to be a tease, not a glitch. This means Dittonut is significant enough to be important to Pokemon's story. To me, I think Game Freak is going to use Dittonut as a continuation to the Mewtwo and Mew story, comfirming our theories.  

In short, Dittonut is going to be used as a continuation to Mew and Mewtwo's story. Adding shock value for much older fans. It's not for gen 8, it's probably for post game Let's Go.

P.S. The Kecleon eye theory, it seems too vague, and they do not look the same to me. I believe that was a coincidence, as most Pokemon have the same eyes.

If this made sense to you, thanks for reading. Please feel free to add discussion, or even rebuttle.

What a weird way to begin!,"I was nine. I was well aware of the Pokémania since Gen I, had watched the anime (mostly the first season), and even had a few Pokémon magazines lying around. But my only console was the Gamecube, so tough luck.

Then I offered a temporal trade to an acquaintance of mine. I lent him my Pikmin 1, and I got his Colosseum.

Holy shit was this game awesome.

Back then everyone was still playing Ruby and Sapphire, usually their first game, and didn't know about most Gen II Pokémon. Neither did I.

It was amazing. Imagine having nothing but super rare Pokémon in your team. That was my feeling back then.

Umbreon and Espeon were awesome, but I accidentally killed Makuhita and Bayleef (caught it in the rematch).

When I got to Pyrite, I was mesmerized by Misdreavus. It was very strong (by earlygame standards), looked cute and cool at the same time, and its Shadow Rush animation was almost scary, rolling over with empty eyes. It became a staple in my team and my favorite Pokémon.

Colosseum really doesn't allow having one overleveled Pokémon blast through everything, like most kids do in their first games, and as such I focused on having a balanced team from the start. Until Dakim, I went with the 6 Pokémon snaggable in Pyrite Square, which wasn't bad, but I gradually dropped them as time went by.

I killed all Legendaries in my first try, which sucked, and I only managed to catch Entei in the rematches. He became the backbone of my team.

I remember finding Hitmontop, Gligar and Sneasel really cool, and thinking it was a shame that they weren't really usable.

I played until the first visit to the Snagem Hideout, got tired, and reset the game (I thought I had lost Suicune and Raikou forever.)

My final team consisted of Umbreon (with Shadow Ball AND Faint Attack, because I knew little about type effectiveness), Misdreavus, Entei (With Iron Fail, I mean Tail), Tyranitar, Metagross (with Sludge Bomb because the animation looked cool and the others couldn't learn it) and Heracross. Other Pokémon I trained to around level 50 were Jumpluff (another favorite, Sleep Powder was a blessing), Espeon and Quagsire.

I did another run with the three Legendary Beasts, Misdreavus, Metagross and Jumpluff. I also painstakingly defeated everyone at Mt. Battle and got a Ho-Oh, which was super rare in Gen III. Everyone was super jealous, and I felt like a boss.

Also, by that time I got a GBA with LeafGreen, and I finally enjoyed a normal Pokémon experience. I've played basically every game since then.

So, can others share their weird childhood starts in their Pokémon journey?",,9icomx,,0,,false,1540165605,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9icomx/my_first_pokémon_game_was_colosseum_what_a_weird/,,,false,Discussion,

- Have around 4 mons
- Nickname everything, even if it's dumb

Im going to discuss about Counterfeit Gen3 Games and what can cause corruption to them. Im currently playing a counterfeit Ruby game so I can RNG myself a shiny Latias from Southern Island, I believe it would be easier than on my legit Sapphire cartridge because its not a roamer. From my experience these may (or may not, maybe its random) cause corruption: 
Trading before the elite four(Trading after E4 is fine or Trading and just avoiding E4),

Playing a Gen4 game while the counterfeit is also inserted, 

Turning off while saving(legit carts will still be fine), 

Attempting the cloning glitch(Emerald only)

I really want that Latias, and dont want any corruption here, I cant breeze through the game because Im afraid it might delete if i trade, anyone know if I try to mixed records with my other game(Eon ticket, It works fine on my legit cart) after the E4 will it be fine? Will it receive the ticket? I have thought of just transferring the ticket before E4 then ride the boat on Lilycove when i get there, but from the info from Bulbapedia it said ""The player is able to travel to Southern Island via S.S. Tidal once the Elite Four have been defeated"" They mightve meant for Emerald only because you have to choose one of the eon twins for the island to pick the other.

At the time of that post, the latest Pokemon game that was released was Pokemon Black and White. The next game that was released after the post (Pokemon Black 2 and White 2) featured a Hiker trainer that was named Markus (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hiker_(Trainer_class)#Pok.C3.A9mon_Black_2_and_White_2), I also think his two Pokemon are Minecraft related too.

One of the largest complaints being that the games are just too easy. For the most part this can be totally true if you follow the sinkhole of over-leveling your pokemon. So, here are some fun and interesting ways I've found to make your game more difficult, or simple challenges that you can do to make your experience different then the norm. Some of them are simple or obvious, but I hope some you find interesting. By all means if you have another interesting challenge that you don't see listed, post it in the comments, I'm always looking for ways to spice it up.

1. The classic Nuzlock. If you're a dedicated enough fan to be on the subreddit but not know what a Nuzlock is, you need to get on that. Easily the most popular way to challenge yourself in these games. If you're interested, Google it to learn more, the rules can be complicated enough for its own post.
2. You know that EXP. Share? Throw it away. Forget it exists. The main culprit for over-leveling your pokemon.
3. Stop using power items such as Miracle Seed and Black-Sunglasses, stuff that says ""boosts the power of \*blank\* type moves."" The CPU characters don't use them, so that immediately puts you on top. Strategic based items such as Quick Claw and Berries are fine.
4. Change your battle setting to ""Set."" This stops the game from asking is you would like to switch after you faint an opposing pokemon. This means that the CPU can put out something that beats the pokemon you currently have out, and makes you strategize more.
5. Don't grind unless absolutely necessary. This is one a friend of mine is particularly guilty for. He won't face a gym until all 6 of his pokemon are equal or higher to the leader's Ace pokemon. This makes it far too easy, especially when the gym only uses 3 or 4 pokemon.
6. Stop using legendaries. They're OP as heck, if you take them to the Elite Four of course you're going to wipe them.
7. Challenge: Equal the Gym leader in pokemon. If its the first gym, use 2. If its the 8th gym, use 5. Evens things out a bit.
8. Challenge: Mono-Type playthrough. Play a game through with the restriction that every pokemon at least has to share one type. Makes you really think about Dual-Types and different strategies for facing pokemon that beat out your entire team. 
9. Challenge: Team Limit. This one can get complicated, but basically, you get your choice of 9 Pokemon, no more. You can catch what you want when you want but once you hit 9, catch no more, including legendaries.
10. Challenge: Ditch your starter as soon as possible. There's no doubt that the starters are often some of the better pokemon in the series, but you'd be surprised how great and fun some teams can be without a starter on them. Plus it can break the monotony of repeated playthroughs.",,9fqhs5,,0,,false,1540121451,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9fqhs5/making_pokemon_games_more_funmore_difficult/,,,false,Discussion,

Now for one of these, it has been used but it's the rotom heat form so I didn't really count it since it not the main form. 
The first one would be fairy fighting. This is something that I really want to see even though it would be 2x weak to steel, poison, psychic, flying and fairy. I want this typing because it would be cool to have a cute fighting type and I feel like it would work.
The other one (I have put way more thought in this one) is fire electric typing. Now I'm aware that this typing has been used by rotom's heat form. But I feel like I have a better idea for it. Being a fire electric type, it would be 4x weak to ground and 2x weak to water and rock. I want to make this Pokemon a pseudo legendary because neither fire nor electric has been used in a pseudo legendary before. Obviously give this Pokemon the ability levitate because the combining of fire and electricity would have to occur in the air and couldn't be reached by land.
Yes I am aware of how this sounds almost exactly like rotom's heat form except for it being a pseudo legendary that would be part of a 3 part evolution line. But I feel it would be much better than a oven. Make it a special sweeper with high special attack and speed and balance the other stats out to reach to 600 base stat total of pseudo Legendaries.

Anyone have a unique typing or want to make a new Pokemon that has a typing that is only used once and want to make it better?",,9ft6kq,,0,,false,1540122703,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-6 unovaflair 500 10logo,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9ft6kq/possible_new_pokemon/,,Emboar is the best,false,Discussion,

I find these post fun to make and I find the responses interesting to read because of the varying opinions from person to person.

Honestly Gen 5 has one of my least favorite roster of Pokemon. Not because of the designs, oh no design-wise gen 5 has some of my favorite pokemon. I'm talking about battlewise. And by battlewise I mean in game. Honestly a lot of Gen 5 pokemon suck. They feel like a step down from how well rounded gen 4 roster was.  A lot of Pokemon evolve way too late in this generation and I don't know why. You literally cannot use Pokemon like Hydreigon or Braviary because of how late you get them.  And they aren't the only Pokemon I can think of that are like this. You want to use Mienshao or Bisharp? Hope you have a lot of time on your hands because you ain't getting them until the level 50 and 52 respectively. A lot of the Pokemon that evolve at lower level just straight up are not very good. Liepard, Archeops, and probably many more that I forgot to mention. Even if the Pokemon are good and don't have bad stats their move pool leaves a lot to be desired ~~FUCKING Zoroark~~. 

The pharse ""gen X was the last good generation"" has become nothing but white noise to me. My problem is with is that you hear it's so commonly and they make it so obvious that it was the generation they grew up on so they obviously have a biased towards it.

Black and white and black and White 2 has the worst bottom screen in the series. I know there are a lot of people hate Gen 7's bottom screen but at least gen 7 is at to very least useful to you. Gen 5 isn't useful to you unless you have someone to play locally with or if you are you online what you can't even do now and the things themselves were fucking useless to you. Like why the fuck is there a love checker. This comes off as expecially insulting considering what came before.

You would begin as a Pokémon trainer who aspires to be more than the very best, like no one ever was, or to just catch them all. You want to start up a gym of your own and eventually become recognized by the League. 

In this game you start off with a single Pokémon, as usual. Then you would work to catch more and challenge nearby gym leaders. Once you reached a certain point of progress then the game would change.

After you earned a few badges you’d directed to an old village, off the beaten path, where a failed unofficial gym once ran. You would take ownership of the building by completing some local quests, and then you would have to work to improve the building, continue to train your team, and grow your Pokémon collection. 

After a while you’d start meeting with challengers who want to test this up-and-coming gym. By beating them and growing in renown, the village in which your gym is located would also grow.

Eventually you’d act as trainer, gym leader, and town designer. The end game would involve a trial with the League to obtain official gym status. 

Perhaps this could work with an MMO-type game world. 

EDIT: Just found out that a gym leader quest game idea was once proposed by USgamer’s Kat Bailey. Credit where it’s due!",,9fvfjh,,0,,false,1540123718,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9fvfjh/a_future_spinoff_idea/,,,false,Discussion,

This one I plan to make my argument clear. I also want to make sure to respond to earlier rebuttals made to my claims. 

- *Typing System*
-The typing system in and of itself isn't balanced. With Ice having one resistance, and steel having 11, normal being resisted by a few types(Ghost,Steel,Rock), supereffective against none while ground is resisted by the same amount(Flying,Bug,Grass) yet supereffective against 5. I can go on, but if you know anything about the pokemon typing chart you cannot say it is balanced. If you do, that's a nice meme, a funny joke, but don't kid yourself. Certain types dominate.(*Looks* at Fairy,Dragon and Fighting. ) - Basically I would like Ice to get more resistances, Steel fewer, Dragon one more resist, and so on.

- *Stats*
-  This one is rather simple. Some fully evolved pokemon have stat totals of 600, and others of 285. And don't just say,""that's because they deserve to be better"". If they truly do, lets see them have the same, fair playing ground. If they're both at 600, they both get the same chance at being good, not just through handicaps and stat steroids. I hear all you competitive players saying, ""oh, I outplayed him"". It feels nice to outsmart your opponent. But when other factors are involved, such as the opponent's pokemon simply being faster, stronger, and better defensively then yours, it isn't skill that's evolved. It's exploits. Exploits are utilizing certain factors of the game that aren't properly balanced. Remember weather in Gen 5 OU? Dragons in pre gen 6 games? Snorlax in GSC? They weren't balanced, but they're fixed to an extent now. And so new exploits come out, such as Tapus and Z-moves.  You can't use your favorite pokemon, because it sucks. It is just bad, because Gamefreak does not care about the competitive metagame whatever. Which is wear this problem stems from. 

- *Singled Out* -n This spot is specially made for those poor pokemon that are singled out, targeted because of exploits. Stealth Rocks is one example, as it only targets 4 types(Fire,Flying,Bug,Ice), whereas other types are relatively safe and a select few don't even care, (Fighting,Ground,Steel). Are bug types really so scary that they need that 25% hp nerf every time they switch in? Are Ice types so good defensively that that bulk needs to be cut into? Furthermore, Pursuit stand out as another stellar example. Ghost and Psychics are singled out, with their 16 brethren laughing at pursuit so long as they have a half decent defense stat. With a 600 BST Exploit Tyrant thrown in, who abuses weather to boost his special defense, and can stack an assault vest to even further make things sad for your poor special ghost/psychic. All he needs is one safe switch in to erase your pokemon from the game. All because of the 2/18, that accursed typing. It feels bad. It feels *broke*.

- *Abilities* - Wonder Gaurd vs Keen Eye, Speed Boost vs Inner Focus, Huge Power vs Big Pecks,Magic Bounce vs Steadfast, and so on. No. Just no. They add diversity, but really have a hierarchy. Just look at the AAA banlist. 

 - *Conclusion* - In conclusion, due to unfair stat advantages, an unbalanced typing system, exploits,  certain types being singled out, and the ridiculous differences in a crutch&amp;clutch ability vs this ability hurts more than it helps, I firmly believe pokemon from a purely competitive standpoint is unbalanced. I will update this thread to cover anything I missed. Any Questions?

The weird thing is, I like each saga for completely different reasons. Like here's a few examples:

Kanto: The overall humor, chemistry, Misty/Brock are funny, the somewhat sense of darkness and weird plots

Hoenn: May is my favorite main girl, I loved the Contests, Ash started to become more competent

DP: I liked Dawn too, the Ash/Paul rivalry was great, lots of good recurring characters and Ash had a good team

BW: I at least liked Cilan, lol

XY: Liked Bonnie/Clemont, Serena's ship with Ash was good although I wish she did more, then the competent Ash and his team, the animation and battles were at their best  
SM: I actually enjoy the sillly aspect of the saga, Kiawe, Lana are cool

&amp;#x200B;

The weird thing is, I like each saga for completely different reasons. Like I can love Kanto for nostalgia and everything, but I can also love the DP and XY sagas for what they did. Or how May is my favorite girl but I can like the others.

It's weird because a lot of people feel that if you love the original Kanto saga, you can't enjoy any later saga or it ""betrays your nostalgia"" or if you like DP or XY, you're watching sagas without Misty in them.

It's hard to describe really, but you can like classic sagas of the anime and new ones (or ones in the middle) at the same time.

All jokes aside tho, in Episode 33 of the Pokemon Sun And Moon anime, we see Lana on a boat with Ash, trying to find the totem Pokémon. On the boat, Lana gets a spider sense like ability for a second and senses the presence of the totem Pokémon. This is where my theory started to develop. Sure this could’ve been played off as a joke or a dramatic scene, this could be a possibility. We know that Lana’s family is of a long line of fishermen. We also know that this Pokémon world has a system close to God’s with Mythical Pokémon and Legendarys holding powers unimaginable to us mortals. My theory is, that an unreleased mythical Pokémon of the water types had the ability to transform (as we see with Pokémon like mew and ditto) and mated with an ancestor of Lana’s and gave them powers over water types. We also see this ability of Lana’s in play earlier in the episode. The “master fisherman” (that is played for jokes) had Lana try and catch a Febas that he had been trying to catch for years (which was also just a joke). But when Lana pulls up a Febas on her first try, the master fisherman is genuinely surprised. This wasn’t played for jokes, this man was actually shook that she caught it so fast. Not to mention, even in the games Febas have a very low encounter rate and would be impressive to anyone if you could do that. This could have been Lana’s ability to call Pokémon or sense their presence. And before you say “but wait this is just a kids anime it wouldn’t do something like that. Having a human breed with a Pokémon! Ew!” Must I mention how the anime time and time again gets darker every season? Remember how they literally killed off a parent like figure to Litten just so that he could go with Ash? All bets are on the table. And if a future Water type mythical gets released in the future with the ability to transform I will take that as a confirmation of my theory. Let me know what y’all think in the comments am I a new breed of stupid or could this have some base?

Over the years I began to like Gen I for some reason. When Pokémon Go came out, I dove in and played until I reached level 23, then it became a grind.

When Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee got announced, the mobile integration got me back in it and I’ve been hooked on Pokémon now. Being a remake of Yellow makes me wanna go back and play the games.

I’ve never been big on RPG’s but the exploration and the collecting (Pokédex) really appeals to me. I know some of the basics about the games, how the generations are divided, always two games, with a third one added, or sequels and remakes. The things that doesn’t appeal to me is buying 3 games per generation.

So, where do I begin?

Do I play a newer game like Ultra Sun/Moon just to see if I enjoy the games? Will the older games seem outdated if I do this?

Do I start from the beginning?

From what I’ve seen, I would play Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, Platinum. Do I replace Yellow with FireRed/LeafGreen?

Do I play the remakes instead of the originals?

I know the ones that don’t have that third game would just come down to the exclusive Pokémon in it and what I want to catch.

Another question I have is this, is there a way to play the least amount of games and get a full or near full Pokédex? If anything, I wanna be able to get the most of filling out the Pokédex with the least amount of games.

The only thing I could guess with yanmega is that bugs were bigger and shit in the past. Whatever. 

Now it's abilities are both sun based ones. I never really cared for weather based stuff. But, it's hidden ability regenerator is always a nice one to have, i'd say. Get a tangela real quick from the virtual console and send that fucker up. 

I would have no idea what moveset to give it though. When in doubt, I just go stab and some coverage. Throw an assault vest on it for that special defense. Eh. And it's design isn't over the top or anything. Just a larger tangela with them big ol' arms.

Let's talk in universe.   

This won't apply just to Ash, but humans as a whole. Hear me out. 

Humans are Pokémon. Humans have 3 stages of evolution - infancy, teen and adulthood. Most characters in the series are either already in their final evolution, or at a middle/stagnant evolution because it's their choice. 

Ash refuses to evolve because as a kid he has more advantages in the Pokémon universe, his childish behaviour and curiosity helps him bond with pokémon better and explore the world more. 

Other humans Ash have met who haven't aged are also working on their hobbies/goals. They maintain youthfulness because its a ripe age to follow your dreams.  

Once humans achieve what they wish in life and want to settle down with a possible loved one they proceed into their final evolution which allows them to breed and take responsibility for the new generation of Pokékids.  

This is the reason why the human population in the Pokémon world is much less.

Many people have been begging Nintendo to develop a sequel to the Nintendo 64's popular but underselling Pokémon Snap game. Their newer home and handheld devices have opened up possibilities for gameplay that Pokémon Snap could greatly benefit from.

Nintendo seems to think otherwise... I beg to differ. Nintendo likes to boast that they are the only ones that know how to make good games because they start with gameplay ideas first before they develop anything else. I'll do the same and I'll thereby prove that Pokémon Snap could be a big shot for Nintendo if they gave it a chance. Especially in this selfie-obsessed culture that we live in.

So, if you ever played the original on the Nintendo 64 (or the port on the Wii), you'll know that the game features everybody's favorite Pokémon photographer Todd from the anime. On an island, separated in a dozen or so different environments, you basically shoot pictures of Pokémon from the comfort of a vehicle that takes you from the start of the level, to the finish. It's basically an on-rails shooter, but you're shooting pictures of Pokémon in the environment. When you finish going through the level, the game, personified by everybody's favorite Pokémon professor Oak, evaluates your pictures under a limited number of criteria (like, if the Pokémon is in the center of the picture) and attributes it points. After shooting a certain amount of points and different species, you unlock new levels, tools, and upgrades. This is the simplest way that I can explain the game. So, where do we go from here? Here are some new mechanics I thought of:

**Environment**

* No more on-rails but third-person open-world, *Breath of the Wild*\-style, or with transitions between environments, like in a typical Pokémon game.
* Environment offers collectables that can be used to lure Pokémon or trigger different behaviors in them to set them up for a nice shot, such as (but not limited to) wild berries, pebbles, flowers, etc.
* A companion Pokémon might be trained to aid in finding or setting up Pokémon for the perfect shot.
* Certain environments require special gear to become accessible, like diving gear and camera for underwater Pokémon photography, or special heat protection for volcano Pokémon.
* The environment could provide certain obstacles that can be overcome by unlocking/purchasing gear, such as, for example, rope to hike up a mountain.
* Some obstacles might be overcome with the companion Pokémon (there could be more than one and you could swap them out).
* No environment puzzles, unless maybe for special Pokémon (legendary and mythical). Adding puzzles would be a little bit too much. The game should focus on shooting pictures.
* No environment hazards. You can't ""die"" or ""game-over."" You can only run out of space on your camera's memory card and just have to go back to the town/city to save them or something like that.

**Camera**

* A trigger button would make the player go into ""shooting mode"" where they see from the camera lens (first person). Movement becomes slower. Other camera options, like zooming, become available.
* Camera's should be tools of which you can't carry more than one type around, or you can damage them if you use them in the wrong environment. Some will be fitted for underwater shooting, others for high temperatures, etc. You can swap them at some sort of ""Pokémon Center"" kind of place in a town or city, making you plan your trips out into the wild.
* Cameras should have upgrades, like better zooming lenses, which you could carry a variety of with you and swap out *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*\-style.
* Initial memory cards for the camera could store a more limited amount of pictures and be upgradable.
* Of course you should be able to delete bad pictures to free up space in your memory card.
* You should be able to save pictures on something like a personal laptop, definitely more than on your memory card, so that you can sell them or use them later.
* The shutter speed should be low. I don't want to encourage the player to shoot the same thing too often. Exploration and experimentation should be rewarded instead.

**Inventory**

* Of course, a real photographer carries around a bag full of tools. Todd would use it to store items he purchased, cameras and other tools.
* Other tools could be musical instruments, flashlights, hiking gear, etc. (meaning, tools to interact with the environment or to interact with wild Pokémon).
* Inventory could be expandable.
* Other types of bags might be necessary for different kinds of environments.

**Pokémon**

* Pokémon are never hostile. They will never attack the player. Your entire interaction with Pokémon is based on how close they allow you to get to them. More common Pokémon might even play with you or eat from your hands, rarer Pokémon will run away if they even smell you from less than 25 feet or feel that your cutting the wind in front of them. When a Pokémon ""runs away"" it literally runs away from you and immediately vanishes.
* Pokémon spawn in the wild at random with different rates of rarity.
* There could be some unique Pokémon that can be seen only if special conditions are met, like legendary and mystical. Could be tied to a story.
* Some of these special one-time encounters could happen in closed environments (like a dungeon) so that, instead of vanishing, the Pokémon will simply run away from you and you can leave that area when you're satisfied with the pictures that you've shot.
* Pokémon may spawn in the towns/cities.
* Some wild Pokémon might allow you to shoot selfies with them, same for Pokémon in towns/cities.
* Pokémon should have a wide range of behaviors and interactions with each other, the environment, and humans.
* Wild Pokémon can evolve.
* I don't see a need to include all existing Pokémon. I very honestly would prefer to have only the more animal-like ones to be featured... One of the levels that I disliked the most in Pokémon Snapp was the one with the Electrode. I just don't like living creatures that look like objects or machines but that's a personal thing.

**Humans**

* Humans can be found in towns and cities but rarely outside.
* You can interact with humans.
* Humans can be seen interacting with Pokémon and you can shoot pictures of that.
* Some side-quests could involve helping people out by shooting pictures for different reasons.
* Let's bring Team Rocket back, but this time we'll expose them by shooting pictures of the evil they're doing to Pokémon! (This could be part of the story.)

**Economy**

* Your progress is done by earning Pokédollars as a Pokémon photographer.
* Several magazines, research organizations, and others, want you to shoot pictures of X Pokémon doing Y thing.
* They will evaluate your pictures. If you fulfill their criteria (and some general quality criteria) the money they will give you will be higher.
* There should be plenty of recurring opportunities to make a quick buck by selling pictures but the reward should come from more difficult, elaborate shots.
* You should be able to save your favorites in your personal scrapbook (maybe you could buy stickers in-game to make it look nice by arranging the pictures with them).
* Your scrapbook can be shared online with friends or on IRL social media.
* There should be a ""Pokédex"" for pictures.
* I think that pictures should be individual items that can't be copied. I know that this doesn't make a lot of sense, but if you could copy them, it would ruin the whole economy aspect.
* You can go to Pokémon photographer (\*Pokésnapper\*?) markets to buy better gear, items (food, scents, or disposable toys to attract Pokémon), tools, and as many other things as possible.
* Maybe the market should be the place where you can also manage your gear and inventory? Like Bill's PC but for Pokémon photographers.
* There could be an ""online Pokémon photography portfolio"" on *Pokébook* or *Instapoké* or something...

**Other/Miscellaneous**

* It should be possible for you to save and resume anywhere.I want shooting pictures to be about catching Pokémon or things that look like them (like in the Nintendo 64 game). If a picture has no Pokémon on it, it should be immediately discarded.
* Traveling can be made faster through vehicles (a bicycle that you could actually park anywhere would be cool), but there could be public transportation between cities and regions.
* Please include all the regions, you cheapskates! (And all the ""good"" Pokémon, while you're at it.)
* Todd's movement should have a ""noise-meter"" like in *Breath of the Wild* and ways for you to lower the noise you make. Environment hazards should exist that will either make you noisier or help you to reduce noise.
* You should be able to ""befriend"" certain wild Pokémon and maybe even shoot selfies with them.
* Maybe there could be periodical online competitions for pictures?
* Maybe you could send your favorites (or even your scrapbook) as neat... PNGs to an email or allow them to be shared on social media? Oh yeah, optimize that for Instagram too. #pokemonsnap
* No ""zoom and enhance"" nonsense, please.
* What if Todd could also buy outfits?
* Maybe there could be a female playable character too apart from Todd (though they would have to come up with a new character).
* Alternatively, Todd could be an instructor and the player just makes up his/her own character.
* The ""Pokédex"" could have a ""highest value you ever obtained"" record from a picture of each Pokémon.
* Just add a lot of data to every conceivable little detail! Give us numbeeeeeers!

**Graphics**

* The art style of the original game was good. I liked that it combined artwork from the anime. Use that, or use the one from the current Switch games (the ones with Pikachu and Eevee).

**Music**

* I'd actually prefer ""the wild"" to not have background music at all. You should be aware of the noise you make and the noises that the Pokémon make too.
* Alternatively, maybe the music could fade-out as you approach or ""lock onto"" a Pokémon.
* That said, can we PLEASE have the Pokémon make actual animal noises!? Thank you!

**Story**

* Something about global warming, the extinction of fauna and flora, how fragile our environment is, and how bad it is to exploit animals. A lesson on protecting the environment, basically.",,9etp86,,0,,false,1540106120,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9etp86/idea_for_a_pokémon_snap_sequel/,,,false,Discussion,

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

The goal of this event is for you guys to get a chance to rebuild a Pokemon once a week! What do we mean by that? Well we will be looking to find Pokemon who just can't seem to find a niche in their tiers or the current competitive scene and finding ways to revitalize them! This means thinking about new moves, stats, or typings that help give the Pokemon in question a new role.

**This week's Pokemon is Rapidash**

**#078 Rapidash** (Japanese ギャロップ Gyaroppu)

*Fire Horse Pokémon*

*Very competitive, this Pokémon will chase anything that moves fast in the hopes of racing it. It gallops at nearly 150 mph. With its mane blazing ferociously, it races as if it were an arrow.*

**Rapidash's Base Stats:**

* **HP:** 65
* **Attack:** 100
* **Defense:** 70
* **Sp. Attack:** 80
* **Sp. Defense:** 80
* **Speed:** 105

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/rapidash/)

**Introduction:**

* Rapidash is one of the biggest teases of Pokemon; unless you're fireproof, you won't be able to ride on one of them. Rapidash has good speed and passable attack going for it, and STAB Fire-type attacks are great offensively. Unfortunately, its current movepool consists of a lot of recoil, making it reliant on Morning Sun. It also has mediocre defenses and is very vulnerable to hazards, preventing it from being a top-contending Pokemon in the meta. Currently, Rapidash can be seen using Life Orb or Firium-Z/Electrium-Z, as well as sometimes carrying support moves such as Will-O-Wisp.
* Rapidash is one of the OG Pokemon, starting off in UU in gen 1. Gen 4 dropped it to NU despite getting Flare Blitz, Morning Sun and Will-O-Wisp. Gen 5 gave it Wild Charge and Drill Run, but it was still not good enough to get out of NU. It dropped to PU in gen 6.
* As of today in gen 7, Rapidash is in PU. Rapidash's strengths are being one of the uncommon physical Fire-types, its good speed tier, its decent attack stat, some good offensive coverage and immunity to Fire-type attacks via Flash Fire. Its weaknesses are being prone to all hazards, being very reliant on Morning Sun to compensate for Flare Blitz and Wild Charge, lackluster defenses in both its typing and its stats, and being outclassed by Pokemon such as Arcanine. It also has no way of boosting its Attack stat, making it very difficult for it to take down any decent physical walls.

**What changes (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings) would you give to Rapidash to give it a fair shot in the OU meta?**

Voting options for next week's Pokémon will be edited in here and we'll run a one day poll tomorrow before announcing the winner on Thursday. This will then give you some extra time to think of how to revamp the winning Pokémon before the next Rebuild Tuesday rolls around. For today though, [**PM me (/u/SnowPhoenix9999)**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=SnowPhoenix9999&amp;subject=Rebuild+Tuesday+Suggestion) if you have any recommendations for a Pokémon that could use a rebuild!

Seeing what Gamefreak would create with such opposite typings would be awesome and it would make a very quick addition to my team.

What do you guys think, what typings are you dying to see? And what kind of crazy design could that typing bring?

It takes place in a 10-15 gap from the events of Gale of Darkness. A massive explosion comes out of The Under the stadium collapses as a mushroom cloud of purple annihilates the windmill and out of the the tip of the cloud rises a Shadow Ho-oh. A.K.A. XD002.
Basically what I want this Game to do is allow us to catch shadow forms of all 326 families. This game should be as difficult as you make it, all the cipher admins, including completely new ones will have theme teams of Legendaries, for example cute legendaries such as (pardon my spellings)Mew, Shamin, Manaphy, celabie(?) for lovraina. Each playing off their built characters. All trainer battles will be double battles, as is the orre way, some people don't like this but it makes the game more dynamic and opens up access to alot more strategies and with all pokemon it provides infinite combinations of teams and move sets. Your goal is too purify every shadow pokemon which grants you access to an exclusive move in the first slot, often giving a competitive edge such as a sunny day for seadot, or a slacking with skill swap, etc.
Basically it sets up a extremely fun semi-adulty pokemon game that gives new players access to new but getting to mix and match with old and vise versa, it will provide new and returning players a quick access to playing For Glory! as you are given pokemon that start with a competitive move like baton pass, refresh, sunny day etc. as mentioned before. And with access to all pokemon people can build teams and play comp. very easily while keeping it very diverse and try to kick start their esports circuit including splaatoon, smash, project m, and of course mario superstar baseball.  So the game play will consist of the teenage son of wes and rui as our main character, you will journey through orre exploring old and new areas while battling every single pokemon slowly building and getting harder, some of the last area goons will have teams of shadow pokemon that will be reminiscent of gym  leaders and elite four of the past.

THIS GAME SHOULD BE HARD YOU DON'T GET EVERY POKEMON EASILY 

After defeating the head of cipher you can accept mt. Battle challenge. This will be where you can re-try for shadows endlessly, the goal for purifying all pokemon including the shadow Ho-oh, you will receive an archeus egg. Each mt. Battle will be recreation of World champ teams from the past 2 decades making it hard as shit. 





The story begins 5 years after the events of Gale of Darkness. Mirror B. Blows a hole in a prison releasing all of the Cipher Admins in both games as they escape into hiding. 

Que: mushroom cloud

Pyrite town in absolute rampage people running, pokeballs vibrating slowly, with people looking at em,

1 hour earlier
Cut to a house in Agate village with wes and rui inside, a teenage boy announcing he is going to work(trainer before leader). He hops on a scooter like micheals and drives to the gym in phenac town he pulls up next to a hoover scooter, as he walks to the door, Boom the shadow wave hits the town, rushing out... Jovi, eventually you enter the gym and begin training as usual, when you send out your eevee it shows off a shadowy aura that only the main character can see like rui, he ask Jovi and she takes you to the Lab, jovi explains to the mother what is  going on and the adventure begins!

And while these games aren't necessarily part of the CORE series, but kind of are? Idk at this point. There are many worried about how Let's Go could affect the core series as a whole. Which I completely understand and empathize with. BUT, I think there is a possible way Let's Go could, and I mean COULD, improve some aspects of the core series, particularly in well, catching wild Pokemon. Here are the suggestions that I'm thinking of, and I think could be a nice compromise:

First of all, there's wild Pokemon appearing in the over world in Let's Go. I think this could be integrated into the core series quite well, aside from the fact that it well, already has, specifically Wimpod in SuMo. If this came back in the core series with full force, I think only certain Pokemon should appear in the over world and not as wild encounters, and have more fleshed out behaviors than just running away if you're not quiet enough. Something similar to the behavior of enemies in Earthbound is what I'm thinking of for this. Pokemon that appear outside of tall grass will chase you down if your lead Pokemon is a lower level, and will run away if your lead is a higher level. Also, maybe multiple, hostile wild Pokemon can swarm you, resulting in mini hoard encounters (3 Mightyenas outside of the tall grass chase and gang up on you) However, some Pokemon won't always do this. Some will always run away if you aren't quite enough (like Wimpod), while others will always chase you (like Rhyhorn or Mankey) but can be avoided by either outrunning them (riding a bike), evading their line of sight, walking quietly, or not moving if they see you (like Jurassic Park T-Rex, it only sees you if you move). 

But the big thing I want to talk about is that this isn't the first time in Pokemon where you couldn't battle wild Pokemon. Of course, I'm talking about the Safari Zone, which we haven't seen in its prime since Gen 4 (yes, I'm aware of the Friend Safari and ORAS's bastardized Safari Zone, but I'm talking the classical Safari Zone from Gens 1-4). That was what made the Safari Zone unique in previous Pokemon games, there was no battling wild Pokemon and it was all about luck and praying to the RNG gods that that FUCKING Murkrow doesn't run away. But that was also the problem with the Safari Zone, it was all about luck. And from what I've seen, catching Pokemon in Go takes some sort of skill? What I'm saying here is, what if for Gen 8, they bring back the Safari Zone, and the Go-style of catching Pokemon is restricted to JUST there? I think it would be an interesting way to integrate Go mechanics into the core series without pissing off the hardcore fans, and a real nice compromise between the hardcore and casual sides of the fanbase.

Anyway, those are my thoughts, what do y'all think?

People are misunderstanding the purpose of the let’s go games, they’re for attracting the casual fanbase into the main line Pokémon series which is still coming next year.

Binge-watching Generations is fun but it always leaves me wanting more. It shows me the world of Pokémon from a different perspective and it almost makes me pissed of by the fact that we have Ash Ketchum despite loving him as well. I just can't help but wonder, why can't we have two?

The candidates are

Rowlet -&gt; Dartrix

Torracat -&gt; Incineroar

Poipole -&gt; Naganadel

I have a feeling Poipole will evolve in the next episode since it's the climax of the Necrozma arc, but I could be wrong. If not it'll probably evolve at some point. 

Normally I wouldn't be too optimistic about Rowlet evolving, but with Stenee evolving into Tsareena , one evolution we definitely didn't see coming, anything is possible.

Anyway, Rowlet evolving sooner seems more likely to me simply because it's possible, he hasn't evolved once yet, and the anime is probably ending next year, so there's more to worry about with Rowlet than sleeping in Ash's bag. I'm predicting a full Evolution by the time the Pokemon League starts (Ash will probably lose this in the finals RIP)

Last there's Torracat who let's be honest, is definitely going to evolve into Incineroar. There isn't much to say about that, so I'll predict when he'll evolve. I'm guessing it'll happen by Ash's fourth grand trial.

I'm not even considering what his sixth team member will be for this post because that's something for a post of its own

I have the opinion that just because a Pokemon exists doesn't mean it's obligated to be in every single Pokemon game.

&amp;#x200B;

Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Gates to Infinity only featured gen 5 Pokemon and a handful of others. Overall it wasn't too stellar of a game but it had a decent story. Mystery Dungeon games don't even have a Pokedex anyways. Now Super Mystery Dungeon featured all Pokemon species, all 721 Pokemon at the time. Okay. And it had a good story as well. But after clearing the main story, recruiting new Pokemon for those that want to it's just tedious connection orb quests. It almost seems like they put in every single Pokemon to artificially increase game content. Quality over quantity.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Pokemon Sun and Moon features all Pokemon, the Pokedex doesn't, but I don't think that makes it a bad game. There's still around 300 or 400 for the Ultra versions to collect and you could always trade for or Pokebank for the rest for those that must absolutely play with their favorites.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the Let's Go games, I would actually prefer only the 151 Kanto Pokemon because these games are a homage to the original Red/Blue/Yellow. I'm not a genwunner and I like completing the Pokedex too, which is why I'm excited for the next main series games for gen 8. Assuming Let's Go only has the Kanto region and story, it's relatively short compared to other games anyways, so what purpose would artificially adding over 600 Pokemon serve? Again quality over quantity, that's what I would rather have a game be.",,9f2by0,,0,,false,1540110163,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-3 kantoflair 4 10logo,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9f2by0/unpopular_opinion_not_every_single_pokemon_needs/,,,false,Discussion,

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

The goal of this event is for you guys to get a chance to rebuild a Pokemon once a week! What do we mean by that? Well we will be looking to find Pokemon who just can't seem to find a niche in their tiers or the current competitive scene and finding ways to revitalize them! This means thinking about new moves, stats, or typings that help give the Pokemon in question a new role.

**This week's Pokemon is Bellossom**

**#182 Bellossom** (Japanese キレイハナ Kireihana)

*Flower Pokémon*

*Bellossom gather at times and seem to dance. They say that the dance is a ritual to summon the sun. When the heavy rainfall season ends, it is drawn out by warm sunlight to dance in the open.*

**Bellossom's Base Stats:**

* **HP:** 75
* **Attack:** 80
* **Defense:** 95
* **Sp. Attack:** 90
* **Sp. Defense:** 100
* **Speed:** 50

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/bellossom/)

**Introduction:**

* On the surface, Bellossom doesn't seem to be much. There are a plethora of Pokemon in low tiers who can do the Grass-type's job better than it, whether it's in terms of a bulky set (Eviolite Roselia/Tangela, Gourgeist) or as a sun sweeper (Victreebel). However, it seems like it gets new tools to play with that these guys don't have, such as the ever so great Quiver Dance and a great crippling + recovery tool in the form of Strength Sap. Today's Bellossom sets utilize both of these with Giga Drain and Moonblast, holding either Grassium-Z, Life Orb or Leftovers with Safeguard instead of Moonblast.
* In gen 2, Bellossom was in UU. It dropped to NU in gen 3 and remained in NU all the way until gen 6, where it dropped to PU despite finally getting something somewhat useful like Moonblast.
* Bellossom is still in PU today. Bellossom is essentially the definition of ""most average Pokemon"". It has average stats, average moves, and average abilities. That in itself could be seen as a weakness, as it doesn't have any niche or reason to be used over other Grass-type Pokemon. It also has a very miniscule offensive movepool. However, it has very good tools such as Quiver Dance and Strength Sap, giving it the potential to become a very powerful, speedy and bulky Pokemon.

**What changes (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings) would you give to Bellossom to give it a fair shot in the OU meta?**

**In addition to ways to make this Pokémon competitively viable again, feel free to discuss your likes and dislikes about this Pokemon, be they from your playthroughs of the main series or side games, your success or failure with this Pokemon competitively, any cool fan artwork (with the source) featuring this Pokemon that you'd like to share, or anything else!**

**We'd also suggest checking out our** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/pokemon) **each Tuesday for live discussion on these topics as well!**

On Wednesday, we ran a poll to determine which Pokémon will be the focus of next week's Rebuild Tuesday. The candidates were as follows:

* Cloyster
* Avalugg
* Walrein
* Dewgong
* Crabominable
* Aurorus
* Alolan Sandslash

The winner and next Pokémon to be featured will be **Avalugg**. Feel free to start thinking up ideas now, and we'll look forward to seeing everyone's thoughts on the next Rebuild Tuesday!

Bellossom

* Solar Beam
* Sleep Powder
* Sludge Bomb

Feraligatr

* Ice Punch
* Surf
* Bite
* Dynamic Punch

Espeon

* Bite
* Psychic
* ?

Crobat

* Confuse Ray
* Fly
* Toxic
* Mean Look

Arcanine

* Extreme Speed
* Dig
* Flamethrower
* ?

Marowak

* Earthquake
* Thunderpunch
* ?

Let's assume you just started your adventure, and you aren't interested in catching them all but building a team of the best Pokémon you can trust.   

***We are excluding competitive.*** 

Here's what I do:  . 

* What do you want to be? If you wish to be the champion, or someone who explores a lot you need a mixed type team. If you want to settle down somewhere or be a gym leader or maybe study a single type you can choose a monotype team. Then again it depends.  

* While choosing your pokémon, imagine how it would be if you are actually in the pokémon universe. How practical are the monsters for you besides just battling? 

* For example a water Pokémon can help you cross water bodies, a Pokémon which can fly is basically free transport, a psychic type can do almost anything, etc.  

* Have a diversity of types! I mostly dislike monotype teams. 

* No pokémon is objectively bad, so don't be afraid of choosing any Pokémon having a compatible aesthetic with your character or team.   

* But make sure you have the best movepool for them, I usually make my every Pokémon have a diverse movepool and ability so it can stand up by itself against any opponent. I don't assign different builds like for example one being a sweeper one being a tank etc I try to make all the Pokémon have a balanced build with at least one type exclusive STAB move.   

* Have at least one pseudo-legendary or dragon type, and each one of the 3 standard types (fire, water, grass). 
 
* If you are going for a monotype team, select a *theme* instead. For example Pokémon of the sea/near the beach/near water bodies don't need to be all water type. Pokémon of the woods don't need to be only grass, you can select green coloured Pokémon or something which would fit the theme of woods. 

* Have one Pokémon which is a good buddy and easy to explore around with. Like Pikachu, Eevee, any small Pokémon which can climb on you. 

* A Mega Evolution is a must. 

* Experiment. You can catch more than 6 Pokémon who are powerful and keep switching between them to try different combinations. Sometimes it's not necessary that you have only 6 Pokémon I completed Emerald with only 2 (Sceptile and Gardevoir).

Hello everyone! Im in a bit of a dilemma. I need a water poke while on my nuzlocke. I just beat Claire and got my final badge before facing the E4 then moving to Kanto. I've lost 2 Gyrados so far (RIP Scylio and Monni) thanks to his 4x electric weakness. Now I've got a Chinchou and a magikarp and in need of a water poke. Should I make Gyrados #3  or try something new. Granted I already have an ampharos in my party and a backup electric in jolteon but the tms needed for him is what made me go with ampharos in the first place. Chinchou has volt absorb btw.

My team so far is 

Typlosion 

Nidoking

Heracross 

Ampharos 

Empty Space  (lost my vileplume to Claire)

Water Pokemon 

On one hand Gyrados is a powerhouse with a great ability but that 4x electric weakness hurts. I already have nidoking and Heracross as solid physical attacker.

On the other hand Lanturn is unique, has a solid ability to soak up electric attacks, and can fit the role of my water AND electric poke in the event I loose or swap Ampharos. But then again it's stats aren't the best and I already have Ampharos and even nidoking to counter electric moves. 

What do you guys think? I truly can't decide so I figured I'd leave it up to you. Thanks!

	First and foremost, please do not comment/ reply with anything like “why are you trying to use a hail team? Hail teams suck!”, or, “there’s your problem, your trying to use a mono ice team, ice type is on of the worst typings”. I know that  having a mono ice team is a terrible idea, I am aware of its horrid defensive typing, limited selection, and in general, its propensity to be a pain in the butt. That being said, I love ice type pokemon, and part of the reason that I’m running an ice team is because of the complexity which is involved in trying to pull one off.  I’m assuming that I could probably beat the battle tree pretty easily if I ran a team of 4 pokemon that all had base 600 stats, decent speeds, and incredible mega evolutions. But thats not the hand I’ve dealt myself, and I feel pretty elated when my mono ice team takes out an opposing speed boost mega blaziken or mega metagross ( the banes of my existence). Ever since the first generation I have favored ice types, and for the entirety of my pokemon playing experience, I have always attempted to face each elite four with a signature mono ice type team. So I’m just continuing on with that nostalgia. 

	That all being said, I have for the past year been trying in vain to get 50 straight wins at the battle tree in pokemon Sun (not ultra). I have for the greatest extent of this time been attempting the Super Double battles, and find that I can, more or less, generally get to about 30-40 wins with a mono ice team (I think my highest has been 48 wins? At least 44). Something always happens which results in a loss, and I’m getting pretty irked that they have announced a new game and I still haven’t met my self made goal. So here is the gist, I need someone else to look into building a mono ice team with new eyes so that they can possibly point out a strategy which i have missed. Here are the teams that I’ve ran so far. 

My most successful team so far. 

1. Abomasnow, (abomasite). Ability: Snow warning
Modest nature, 252 evs in special attack, 252 evs in HP.           
1. Energy Ball
2. Blizzard
3. Protect
4. Focus blast

2. Alolan Sandslah (life orb) Ability: Slush Rush
Adamant nature, 252 evs in speed, 252 evs in attack. 
1. Icicle crash
2. Leech life
3. Rockslide
4. Earthquake 

3. Alolan Ninetales (expert belt) Ability: Snow Warning
Modest Nature, 252 evs in speed, 252 evs in special attack. 
1. Moonblast
2. Freeze dry
3. Hidden power fire
4. Protect. 

4. Beartic, (focus sash) Ability: slush rush
Adamant nature, 252 evs in speed, 252 evs in attack
1. Icicle Crash
2. Rockslide
3. Brick break
4. Flail, earthquake

	The idea behind this team is obviously, rush the shit out of anything before it can attack me. And for the most part, it works pretty dang well. My Sandslash gets a lot of use and recovery out of leech life,(because its taking damage from the life orb every turn) and most psychic and dark types are easily swept aside, which is important, because psychic pokemon, (I’m looking at you Reniculus, slowking, oranguru and Bornzong) like to set up trick room as  soon as they can, which really destroys the premise of my team. Secondly, I NEED to be able to hit Bronzong with SOMETHING at least neutrally with both my pokemon to take it out in the first turn, and sometimes it runs with the levitate ability which renders sandslash’s earthquake moot. 
	Now you might be thinking, “WHY ON GOD’S GREEN EARTH would he start with not one, but TWO pokemon which are 4X weak to fire?! And I’ll tell you why. It’s because originally I would lead with ninetales and sandslash to avoid this problem, HOWEVER, because ninetales has such a high bas speed, if I ever entered into a battle against another weather setter, (hippowdon, tyrantiar, politode, pelipper, normal ninetales, or Torkoal, ) because they’re speed was lower than my ninetales, it meant that the snow warning ability would activate First, and then sandstorm, drought, or dirizzle would activate after, which left me on the field with a sandals whose sweeping ability was in most cases nullified. Therefore, abomasnow, though contrary to first impression, reall is the better hail setter because he is so damn slow that if you invest no evs in his speed, and no ivs in his speed, he usually ends up being the last weather system to activate. Furthermore, if any pokemon do try to set up another weather system on me after they have entered into the battle, I can mega-evolve my abomasnow and immeadiatly, without wasting a turn, to set up hail again to complement my slush rushers. Also, an added benefit is that ground type attacks hit abomasnow for half damage due to his grass typing which makes earthquakes not a big deal if i can’t protect my abomosnow on the turn that my sandlash uses it use it. 
	fighting types are also extremely problematic for this starting lineup because of Sandslash 4X weakness to fighting (and you might be thinking, “don’t put sandslash on the team then, he has two 4X weaknesses to worry about), but keep in mind,  this bugger is also sporting a whopping (for ice type standards) 8 resistances! with one total immunity. And I know, literally all of that is due to its steel typing and nothing to do with its ice typing, but it is the only pokemon with an ice typing to resist so many other moves, which actually means that when sandslash ,due to his typing and commendable base defense stats, doesn’t encounter a quicker fire or fighting type pokemon, stays on the field longer than anyone else in my party. Furthermore, a huge added bonus to Sandslash his ability to take both steel and rock type attacks with neutral damage, two types which otherwise, (steel more so than rock)  pose serious threats to my team. 
	while we are on the subject of sandslash I’ll walk you through why I run him with both rockslide AND earthquake. I run him with earthquake because it tackles most of the weaknesses which my time as a whole faces. Fire, Rock and Steel pose the greatest threats to my team, (fire and steel in particular) and earthquake hits them all super effectively, in effect, almost eliminating all my weaknesses in one very convenient move. Rockslide on the other hand, hits Fire, Flying, Bug, and Ice supper effectively. Now, it doesn’t really matter that rockslide hits flying supper effectively, because all of my pokemon carry ice type moves which do the job better due to STAB boost. Hitting Ice type super effectively is a nice bonus, because stally Walrein and other ice types sometimes throw a minor hiccup into some battles, but I could honestly due without it on Sandlash because I have abamasnow who has grass type STAB which takes out most bulky ice types super effectively (Walrein, Dewgong, Mamoswine, and Aurorus [if he could be considered bulky lol]). Furthermore, beartic has brick break which makes short work of most ice types anyways. Hitting bug type super effectively comes in handy, but isn’t vital, because the best bug pokemon, (Scizzor and that jousting bug, Escavalier? Are both steel type so it negates the super effective hit with steel typing. Why then do I carry  rockslide?? Because my friends,  2 very important pokemon escape earthquake and royally screw my team over. CHARIZARD Y AND TALONFLAME, (moltress too, but i have never encountered one in battle). So, rockslide is carried SPECIFICALLY to counter these two pesky threats, which come up more often than you might think. Because all it takes is one flame burst, overheat, you name it, double hitting fire type move form one of them to screw me over. Rockslide KO’s them both because they have a 4 times weakness to rock. 
	Now in addition to Fire and Steel, bulky water pokemon often pose a threat because they like to set up rain, which ruins my speed, and powers up their moves, and they resist my ice STAB moves. I’m talking about you Milotic, Vaporean, Wishiwashi, Primarina. Abamasnow help to counter this nicely if he can stay alive, and ninetales with freeze dry can usually 2 hit KO them. 
	
This is taking way too long, so instead of explaining every minute detail for why i have what moves for what reasons, I’ll talk about the most common nightmares that this team faces. 

1. Ferrothron: this guys a real bastard, he almost always sets up a sandstorm. Then uses thunder wave to slow down my sweepers, and sometimes carried iron head which which deals out good damage. Secondly HE IS ONLY WEAK TO FIRE. Which means I always have a hard time taking him out because he is so damn bulky, can usually carries ingrain and holds leftovers. My only counter to this is an earthquake from sandslash, which usually deals around 1/3 of his health before recovery. Which means IF IM LUCKY, that my ninetales can finnish him off with hidden power fire. 
2. Bronzong: same reason as ferrathorn. His is only weak to ground, or fire, and surprise surprise, it just so happens that both of his damn abilities pretty much negate the weakness to one of these types. MUST BE NICE BRONZONG. Compounding this issue is you never know which ability he is running until you actually try hitting him with earthquake or hidden power fire, in which case you often lose a turn just trying to figure out his weakness. AND! THIS SHITHEAD spams trickroom and rain dance like its nobodies business. Which really means he is screws up my lineup. I’ve even ran a team with mamoswine to counte him, by like I said.....his ability levitate mocks you when you miss and makes the whole idea of running a ground type pok me on to counter him moot. Sure wish there was an ice/fire pokemon...who would have a 4X weakness to rock...
3. Emboar: he is just so bulky, even a life orb adamant earthquake doens’t one hit KO. 
4. Blaziken: speed boost ruins my team if he mega evolves and survives a single turn. 
5. Scizzor: see everything I said about Bronzong... except he doesn’t trick room or raindance, he has stab bullet punch and resist most attacks.
6. Metagross: he mega evolves, and he has bullet punch...and has 600 base states before mega evolving. 

These are the biggest threats. Obviously mono fire teams are often problematic if I can’t get my earthquakes off, or if they avoid my rockslides. Salaazzle should get a special shout out, you speed demon shit. Mega kangaskhan is a real doozy to fight as well. 

I’ve also tried a trickroom, frostbeathing my anger point crabominable strategy with other slow ice types and that failed. Ive tried, mega Galilee explosion gimmicks...Laura’s/jinx perish songs stallers...and countless other strategies. Let me know if you guys can say any fixes to my set, or if you would like to pose a completely different ice team which you think works better. I would love to hear anything! I’ve been in this fight alone for too long lol. Shell smashing Cloyster is VERY promising in singles battles so far, though this seems unreadable in a double battle setting. 

If you read all this, thanks for reading....please reply. Even if just to talk about any other mono-type team, i think they’re cool and rewarding to play with.

I am not that technically with it when it comes to the fine details of Pokemon builds though, my brother now helps me with that.

At 25 I finally made the effort and finished Y after playing Pokemon since yellow. My team was:

Thanks to /u/Invis- for designing the Mimisnoo! It's served us well.  

###And since Mimi was created by the community, we think the next logo should be, too. So we'd like you to submit a design in this thread!   

*****  

**Details:**  

The subreddit logo represents /r/Pokemon around Reddit, including in mobile apps and both the old and new site layouts, as well as [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pokereddit) and elsewhere. If the sub picks your design, we'll credit you in the sub description, and link to a social/store page of yours there as well.   

The logo should be **at least 256x256px, and should have a 1:1 length-width ratio.** If you're design has a different ratio, just put some transparency around it to hit the 1:1. Please upload your design as a **PNG** either way. You're welcome to post a full-sized version alongside your submission if you alter your design to fit the ratio!

**To submit a design,** post an Imgur link, or other image link, to it as a reply to this thread. We'll be setting the thread to contest mode and leaving it open for at least a week for people to see and vote on designs. If we get multiple great candidates, it's likely we'll do a separate, final vote thread as well to pick a winner. We encourage you to submit your design as its own art post on /r/Pokemon, too!

I mean Pikachus were supposed to have a rarity of 5% in Veridian Forest but in most playthroughs I see them appearing quite abit. Don’t get me started on Bulbasaur &amp; Oddish spawning there.

A recent playthrough also a Rapidash spawning on Route 17. In RBY we couldn’t even catch a Rapidash and had to evolve it.

I just wonder how the rarity of Pokémon will be balanced in Lets Go. In Yellow it was so pleasing to find that Pidgeotto in the Veridian Forest or hunting down a Kangaskhan/Tauros in the Safari Zone.

So, my question is, is it worth it to play both? Are the sequels ""more complete versions"" (a la US/UM) of the originals, or does each bring something new to the table? Basically: any recommendations on how to tackle these?

I spent the last few days reading up on typing and good pokemon, also i found a team builder online, so i tryed building a little bit. My planned team (later game) will be something like 

Infernape

Gengar

Garchomp

Starmie

Togekiss

Based on a super successful event we've been hosting on [our partnered Discord server](http://www.discord.gg/pokemon), we're back with another round of **Mystery 'Mon Mondays!!** Much like the popular TV show commercial break special, *Who's That Pokémon?*, it will be your job to tell us the mystery Pokémon... BUT WITH A TWIST!

Every Monday morning we'll post a cropped section of a Pokémon. Here are the rules:

* The cropped section will be from an official rendering of the Pokémon. This could be Sugimori art, Dream World art, a sprite, TCG art, or any other piece of official art.
* The cropped section will have a filter applied to it to distort it just a bit. This filter may alter the color just a *slight* bit, but we don't mess with stuff like the rotation or saturation.
* The Pokémon may or may not be shiny. If it's shiny, you will need to specify that in your guess.
* If the Pokémon has multiple forms, you will need to specify the form in your guess.
* At the end of the day we'll award users who guess correctly one point on our scoreboard.
* Once you've submitted a guess for the week's picture, you cannot submit a second one.
* **Users with 5 correct guesses will earn themselves a nifty ball-flair**

## Submit your guess as a one word answer [in this Direct Message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Mystery-Mon&amp;subject=Mystery+%27Mon+%2334)

Please note that we've been informed that there have been some issues with the bot not working right. We hope to have these issues fixed soon, but we'll also be checking PMs sent to the /u/Mystery-Mon account in the meantime. Once the bot's fixed, we'll also recheck past weeks' entries to make sure we've got them all counted correctly!

*Without further ado,*

-not only do I enjoy the design but with the Dexnav I can get one with the technician ability. Also shroomish can be found early on and it should prove useful especially early on in the game.

Steel, fairy: Mawile
- I have never used Mawile before mainly due to it having average stats and a poor movepool in the original 3rd gen games and due to it being a single stage Mon I never gave it any attention before the mega was released. However I do love the design of the normal form as well and the movepool is quite vast in 6th gen. Also you find the megastone very early on in the game so this is a definite plus.

Dragon, Flying: Altaria
- one of my favourite flying types from any gen and one of those Pokemon I just can't get tired of. Even if the stats are mediocre the movepool for an in game run is amazing and I just love the design it has. Being able to get the mega is also amazing even if you basically can sweep the whole E4 with it. This fluffball is something I will definitely use on a 3rd gen run.

Dark: Absol
- One of my all time favourite dark types period. The stats are great for an ingame run and the fact that you get the megastone at around the same time from when you can catch Absol is great. Even if I have already used the mega on a different Pokemon during the battles I can just spam the high critical hit ratio moves as the combination of super luck + Amie boosts make not getting crits you be very unlucky with high crit chance moves.

Fire: Ninetales
- the last time I used Ninetales was in Leafgreen back in the day so it has been a while. Back then the movepool was quite shallow but nowadays it is actually quite vast and due to being able to get a Ninetales with drought via the Dexnav it even gets a boost to its fire type moves and a single turn solarbeam as coverage. I again love the design of this Pokemon even if it has relatively poor stats.

Last chance for a limited edition flair!,"**Today is the last day to get your limited edition ballflair for the sub.  We'll be shutting down the setting of the flair sometime early tomorrow.**


Original post:

------

Something momentous happened ten years ago this week. A new place was created. A home on the internet for Pokemon fans of all types.   

Over time, the sub has moved from its humble beginnings as a home for lovers of fanart, competetive players, and collectors who Gotta Catch 'Em All, to become a modern titan of Pokemon featuring people who want to perpetually debate which region is the best, which is the best starter pokemon, or whether or not Serena should go to Alola.  (With a few bits of fanart along the way.)

*****

**/r/Pokemon turns 10 years old this week!** In that time, we've built one of the largest, most active Pokemon communities around, bringing together fans from all walks of the franchise to create a million-strong subreddit of artists, competitors and collectors. We've got a few things planned to celebrate—read on below!

*****

/r/pokemon was created by the now-inactive /u/slashninja in 2008. It grew slowly for the first half decade of its life, and only got halfway to its current size in 2016. In the last few years, though, the sub has exploded, as has the amount of original contribution to it. If you like, **take a look back at our history via [this wiki page,](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/wiki/million_sub_banner)** which showcases some of the most memorable events and contributions of the last ten years.

*****

**To celebrate the decade, we're going to be offering a [limited-time, exclusive flair](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/475365502940872705/485570487154507786/unknown.png)!** This flair will appear [to the right of your username](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/elp_p6lwMcLayqkLShU57Qc4Hmsn9YPIhkREVgY-WNQ/https/i.imgur.com/yui3R4Q.png) when you post on the sub. If you visit the sub during this event and get it, the flair will remain by your name after the week ends, but it won't be available for anybody else to add—it will be a lasting reminder that you were around to help the sub celebrate this special time.

To receive this flair, you need to do several things, the first of which many of you will have already done:

1) Subscribe to the /r/pokemon subreddit.

2A) If you have not previously set up your flair, use [this link](https://rpokemon.github.io/#flair) to set up your base flair on the sub.

2B) If you already have your flair set up, use [the same link](https://rpokemon.github.io/#flair).  Just select your flair pokemon and text again, even the same as you already have, and submit.

The flair bot will, as part of setting or resetting your flair, give you the anniversary flair.  **Warning.  This does not work on the Reddit App, only on Desktop mode browsers.**


*****

The second part of the celebration will be revealed at a later point in time.

Thank you to everyone for a wonderful ten years so far.

1537195981,pokemon,henriwb,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9gkzbc/how_to_use_pokepelago_and_festival_plaza_guide/,0,10,,,How to use Pokepelago and Festival Plaza - Guide + Discussion,"The pokepelago and festival plaza are two new features introduces in Gen VII, but most of the players don't understand how to use them properly, I'm here to give you an overview and a guide on how to use them to train and hyper train your pokemon the way the pokepelago was meant to be used. (srry for my in training English).  


Gen VII is more casual we all know this, everyone needs to work, study, and have social life as well, all of the new features introduced in this gen came to help us to play in a very little intervals of time and are designed to not use a lot of our time (like mobile games with real time mechanics).

With Pokepelago you can level up, train EVs and get itens even when your are not playing, of course the speed is a little low even using pokebeans, but at least you can get some levels when you are sleeping for exemple.  


I use a very effective way to train to lvl 100, Hyper train, and EV train my pokemon without any trouble, in 1 month i have at least 16 lvl 100 Hyper Trained, Max Evs monsters with not much effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Pokepelago and festival Plaza Buildings are meant to be used together to power up the level training, there are Food Stalls that Give levels when feeding, the most important is the 100FC Food that gives +7lvs to lvl 79 and Lower Pokemon, and the 300Fc Food that gives + 9lvl to lvl 89 and Lower pokemon. You can battle at the Battle Agency to get more FC and level up your Festival Plaza level (+9lvl food are unlocked after festival plaza lvl 40 I think) and you can get 500FC for a 3 win streak (YAYYY no more talking to peaple and play boring minigames to win FC!). You can have Loto Buildings to try get some Bottle Caps to use in Hyper Training too, I have 3 in My Festival Plaza. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 2 separate Boxes to store 2 types o pokemon to manage the train better. 

The ""No Level Cap"" Box - Pokemon that I want to train that are not in level 79, or 89 yet.

The ""To Feed"" Box - Pokemon that has lvl 79 or 89. 

&amp;#x200B;

Put your monsters in the Pokepelago until they reach one of the level Caps (79 or 89), then, remove them and Feed with the corresponding food in the Festival Plaza, repeat the first step if you need, or use 2 rare candies to jump to lvl 100.

The Flow looks like this:

1 - Put a lvl 1 Poke (with a good nature) in the pokepelago. Go to Work, Sleep, Study and have your life until it has lvl 79.

2 - Remove the lvl 79 From the pelago, and give him a +7 food level.

3 - Return the lvl 86 to pelago, and wait until lvl 89.

4 - Give +9 Food to the lvl 89 mon, and get a lvl 98 mon.

5 - If you have sparing Rare Candies give 2 to get a lvl 100.

6 - Use Bottle Caps to Hyper Train you lvl 100 mon.

7 - Return the lvl 100 Mon to pelago to train Evs now, it is very fast to boost 2 stats to max. (or you can use Food Stalls that give EVs to speed this up).

8 - Fix you pokemon MovePool and Ta - DAH! You have a lvl 100 max stats, competitive mon!

&amp;#x200B;

This is my help to trainers. I want to know how do you train your monsters to improve the guide, There's no need to Hack when you have this wonderfull tools to train and level up, you just need to live your life and play at least 30 min a day to do it! =D

I will just go ahead and say that this is my opinion, and as much as I love Pokémon, this whole post is about a negative opinion about it. I've seen others that feel this way as well, and I personally feel that this is becoming a problem.

I just feel like there's a constant ""war"" between different parts of the community. Some people can't accept others' opinions and just move on, and they spend time trying to convince people with differing opinions that theirs is the right opinion. I'm going to bring Let's GO! Pikachu and Eevee into it because that's the most recent area I have experienced this. Here's an example. I've seen videos and comments in the last couple of days about how the games are going to be great, and how anyone that doesn't like them is wrong, a part of the ""bad"" part of the community, or isn't a ""real"" fan. And multiple people are doing this, it's not just one person, and even more people are arguing about it in the comments. This kind of mentality though, the ""This is my opinion, and anyone that believes different than me is wrong"" mentality is a big part of what I think is destroying the community. Expressing your opinion is good, but when you believe that yours is one and only right opinion and tell everyone else that theirs is wrong and that they suck just creates more and more toxicity.

Instead of just stating that they agree or disagree and presenting their own opinions, people have to waste time trying to convince everyone that their opinions are right. We all spend so much time arguing over how good we think the games and what have you are that we kind of forget that we are are a community in the first place. At the end of the day, we all love the same thing: Pokémon. But we just can't seem to be capable of just acknowledging that.

So, there's that. I honestly don't feel that I presented all of my thoughts in the best possible way, I don't think I said as much as I wanted, and I think I got too cheesy at times, so I apologize haha, but that's the best way I can put it for now. I might get rid of this post and word it better at some point.",,9go7in,,0,,false,1540137280,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9go7in/opinion_the_pokémon_community_is_destroying_itself/,,,false,Discussion,

In the name of nostalgia I also spent hours playing heartgold and soulsilver when they were released. I thought they were great remakes. Similar enough to the originals but with enough added to make them fresh. But even then I noticed some things had got easier - mostly just better signposting in the game. More hints from NPC characters and all the HMs much harder to miss. I'm looking at you the hiker with strength in Olivine cafe in gen 2!

Feeling nostalgic I finally caved and bought a 3DS, picking up X as the first game to play. It generally just seemed so easy compared to earlier games. Some particular observations:
* Experience points seem to have been at least doubled from HGSS. Mid game pokemon trainees were giving exp points higher than HGSS elite four. Ended up LV60s fighting the elite four compared to 40s with not a huge difference in game time. 
* Someone randomly hands you a lucky egg!! That's an insult to the hours people spent farming wild chanseys in the rare hope to get one. 
* O Powers further boost exp. 
* The elite four is so much easier. One you can choose the order which helps immensely with prep and training for it. There are also two dragon  type trainers. I got all excited when I got to be champion only to have my L65 Florges literally take down all of Diantha's pokemon but one singlehandedly with no items. 
* The game has so much signposting it is almost impossible to get stuck anywhere. One of your millions of friends will turn up soon! 
* Your ""rival"" is so much easier. He has fewer pokemon and is just not even comparable to Blue or Silver in terms of a threat. 
* Strong pokemon can be picked up literally 10 minutes in to the game. You can have yourself a future Florges, Azumarill, Gardevoir/Gallade and Lucario all by like the third city. Gone are the days of sentrets and ratattas!

I really enjoyed the game despite all of this however it just got me thinking about how things have changed! I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing but it did feel less challenging. I did absolutely no extra training and pretty much cruised though the game with no issues whatsoever. 

Is this just nostalgia or does anyone elsè agree?",,9golai,,0,,false,1540137452,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9golai/new_generations_are_much_easier/,,,false,Discussion,
1537221133,pokemon,PokemonTrainerSP,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9gop4u/a_friendly_opinion_of_what_would_be_nice_to_see/,12,9,,,A friendly opinion of what would be nice to see in Pokemon 2019.,"**Hello, I would like to point out that many of these features are unrealistic and would almost never happen, but they are ideas that I've thought of whilst playing through the main games that I believe would make them a lot more fun! :)**

\--

Main Features:

* A **3D world in 3rd person** with a **full 360 degree rotating camera**. (similar to Mario Odyssey).
* **Difficulty options**: **Easy,** **Medium** &amp; **Hard**. Hand-holding relates to difficulty, e.g. 'little to none' for Hard difficulty. Higher difficulty -&gt; Higher Pokemon levels (in the wild and in battles) and extra Pokemon in trainer battles (with better held-items).
* **Choosing** '**Special Pokemon':** They follow you or you ride on them in the overworld (one or the other). Able to choose up to three Pokemon to follow you if they are all small sizes (under a specific height/width).
* **Wild Pokemon visible in the world:** Can see shiny forms. RNG encounters still available but reduced. Repels prevent both RNG &amp; overworld Pokemon (world Pokemon move/run/fly away from the trainer).
* **Wild Pokemon and Trainer battles take place in the actual world,** rather than cuts to a black screen then the battle starts with a background. Camera changes to the original fixed style.
* **An improvement to the original battling system:** After 22 years of the same battle system in handheld Pokemon, I feel like they should update it, especially now they are moving to a console device. Rather than replace the original system, they should add a building which contains a new battling style (like the 4 player duel in Alola). Could be Pokken or real-time style. E.g. A new 'evade' button to dodge attacks which needs regenerating over time. You gain BP for wins. If it becomes popular, then they incorporate it into some trainer battles in future games.
* **HM's stay removed:** Abilities like Surf, Fly etc. are assigned to a party Pokemon, but do not take a move slot.
* **Soaring returns**: Assign the ability Soar to a suitable flying-type Pokemon. No cutscenes of taking off and landing. Instead, you manually start on land and take off to the skies. When you see your destination, you soar back down to land.
* **Gyms are back, and you can choose the order:** For example, the 1st and 8th gym are set, but the ones in between can be chosen by you in any order. Each one changes its level depending on your order.
* **You can lose your Elite 4 Champion title, and can also earn it back:** Each time you play the Elite Four after completing the game, you can risk losing your title. The person who defeats you becomes the new champion. If it was one of the first four elites, then their place is replaced by the region's professor and the elite becomes the new champion. If it was a challenger e.g. your rival, the four elites stay the same and your rival becomes the champion.

\--

Co-op features:

* **Online coop (up to 4 players):** You all **spawn into a 'friend world' together**. The world is a copy of what your individual saves look like. For example: in your main saves there are trainers in Route 4 you've defeated, whereas your friend hasn't defeated them. In the friend world, when you both spawn in together, for you personally it will copy *your* save and when you go to Route 4 the trainers will have been defeated, so you can walk past them, however when your friend enters the world, it will copy *their* save and so when they are in Route 4, they will have to fight the trainers. This makes it so you don't enter your actual friend's save and access places you can't in your save (e.g. debris removed after gym defeated). Common online features like *battle &amp; trade would be available in Pokemon Center's.* An *exclusive 'friend world' building* where you can enjoy features with ur friends: *unique Pokemon battle styles, Pokemon Stadium* which contains activities like *Pokemon Sprint 100m, riding Sharpedo races etc.* **Story mode parts that you experience will not be viewable to friends, such as battling trainers, NPC's moving etc. Your visible wild Pokemon are also different to theirs. Option to battle together against double trainers.**
* **Offline coop (2 player maximum):** Access to 2 player on your save if a second joy-con is used on your Switch. Your friend, with or without their own personal account/save, spawns into your world. If they have a save, they will join with their party Pokemon. In the Pokemon Center, the 2nd player can access the PC from their save and swap Pokemon. The main player CANNOT access their friend's PC, but **the main PC of the game save can be shared**. *The second player cannot join in on the main player's wild battles. They can enter their own wild battles but any Pokemon caught are transferred to the main PC of the game.* **Single trainer battles will change to a 2v2 format and trainers will use additional co-op mode Pokemon that become unlocked when 2 player is on. This means some trainers will have a party with more than 6 Pokemon.** *The story will be aware of the second player's presence (dialogue changes e.g. 'its scary alone, be careful' to 'stay close with your friend, its scary in there'.* **Any changes on the friend's account will not carry over to their personal save, e.g.  Pokemon taken from the main PC, exp gained. Once the 2nd player leaves the game, any Pokemon in their party which is from the main player's PC spawn back.**

Johto is an interesting region which has a lot of unique pokemon and both are some of my favorites from that region, including the very challenging gym leader Whitney.

&amp;#x200B;

Townspeople &amp; Etc

\-

* Blanche - She could serve as a Trainer for Lillie helping make her and Snowy stronger and giving her a Ice type Z-Crystal and a Z-Ring
* Candela - She could help Kiawe train a bit and grant him a Charzardite Y which could help him in the Alolan Pokemon League
* Hapu - She will be the 4th grand trial Kahuna
* Hau - He could be a great new Rival for Ash and Kiawe as well as a great contender to take part in the Alolan Pokemon League maybe versing Gladion.  He could also become the 8th Ultra Guardian
* Kahili - She can help Mallow become stronger and earn a Grass type Z-Crystal and a Z-Ring
* Ryuki - He would be the perfect wild card to show up in the Alolan Pokemon league with a couple regular Pokemon a Mythical, a Legendary, a Ultra Beast &amp; a Gen 8 Pokemon for his last one showing off his strength in the League and probably becoming the first Champion of Alola
* Spark - He would be a the perfect person to help make Sophocles stronger and give him a Z-Ring and a Eletric type Z-Crystal to power him up
* Professor Willow - He could be a special guest who comes in to teach people about things like Pokestops which could just be a random trade post in the show like a leave something to take something

&amp;#x200B;

Team Skull

\-

* Guzma - He could have his group team up with Team Rocket after they get a second Z-Ring for James
* Plumeria - She could have a Rivalry with Jessie but she's stronger cause she has a Z-Ring, Z-Crystal and a Pokemon that can Mega Evolve which leads Jessie into a search to finding a Wobbuffetite which has never been seen before

&amp;#x200B;

Ultra Recon Squad - Could be a good or bad group that uses and knows a lot about Ultra Beast Pokemon

\-

* Dulse
* Phyco - He could possibly steal Poipole which may help it evolve in Naganadel
* Soliera - She might help by giving us the technology to understand and how to open or close Ultra Wormholes
* Zossie

Welcome to this week's edition of Rebuild Tuesday, a weekly event we're doing along with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pokemon)!

The goal of this event is for you guys to get a chance to rebuild a Pokemon once a week! What do we mean by that? Well we will be looking to find Pokemon who just can't seem to find a niche in their tiers or the current competitive scene and finding ways to revitalize them! This means thinking about new moves, stats, or typings that help give the Pokemon in question a new role.

**This week's Pokemon is Avalugg**

**#713 Avalugg** (Japanese クレベース Crebase)

*Iceberg Pokémon*

*Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel. Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that stands in its way. The way several Bergmite huddle on its back makes it look like an aircraft carrier made of ice.*

**Avalugg's Base Stats:**

* **HP:** 95
* **Attack:** 117
* **Defense:** 184
* **Sp. Attack:** 44
* **Sp. Defense:** 46
* **Speed:** 28

[**Smogon Info**](https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/avalugg/)

**Introduction:**

* Currently, Avalugg's only purpose is to be a dinner table for folks living in igloos. Otherwise, it's... just there. While it does have good utility at its disposal, as well as boasting an incredibly high defensive stat and good physical attack stat, it is offset completely by its many cons, most notably its abysmal special defense, pure Ice-typing and speed. Most sets run hazard removal with Leftovers, alongside Recover.
* Avalugg starts off in gen 6 at PU. It did not gain any worthwhile tutor moves in ORAS; the best it got was Superpower, so it stayed in PU.
* Avalugg is still in PU today. Avalugg's pros are its incredible defense stat, its good attack stat, a decent movepool, and utility such as recovery and hazard removal. Unfortunately, its cons outweigh its pros; it has abysmal special defense and speed, its pure Ice-typing makes it prone to many weaknesses, it is vulnerable to hazards and burns, and its best physical Ice-type attack is Avalanche, which means it has to get hit to receive the base power boost.

**What changes (e.g. new moves, stats, abilities or typings) would you give to Avalugg to give it a fair shot in the OU meta?**

1537863797,pokemon,cdorr25,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9iqcom/all_the_ways_that_grass_types_and_starters_have/,71,94,,,All the ways that Grass types and starters have been screwed by Gamefreak,"So we all know Grass types have it hard. Gamefreak hates the type. Most people point to Ice as the worst type, and you can certainly argue in its favor. But Grass types have it pretty hard too, and I think that the fact that it’s a starter type is quite problematic. Gamefreak has never cared for starter parity, blatantly favoring fire types since just about the beginning, or at least since Gen 2. Most recently, they’ve given one fire starter two megas and another a Mega before its brethren (hi Blaziken). 

Here are some various ways in which Gamefreak shows blatant disrespect toward Grass types:

- obviously, the type chart and balance. It’s pretty crappy that they’d give a starter type the most weaknesses and make it the most resisted offensively all in one. This has been prevalent since gen 1, and on top of that, they made most Grass types share typing with Poison in a gen where Psychic ruled all. In addition, they continuously gave Fire more and more advantages. Admittedly, Fire wasn’t that great in Gen 1 (though frankly still better than Grass at a glance). But since, they’ve overcompensated by giving it more resistances up to a whopping 6, and it’s also one of the best offensive types. Water has always been great. 

- they give the Grass starter lower base stats... because why??? Who knows? But Venusaur and Meganium have lower base stat totals than their brethren. As if it’s not hard enough type chart wise, they need lower stats too, I guess. Eventually they started making them all equal, but they never went back and fixed the base totals of earlier starters. In gen 1, I believe all starters had 425 base stats. But for whatever reason, when the split occurred, they decided that Charizard deserved 9 more points that Venusaur while Blastoise got 5 more. Balanced, right? 

- they always give Grass weaker exclusive moves. In gen 3, Sceptile’s Leaf Blade had a base power of 70, far lower than Blaziken’s and Swampert’s. You could argue that was to balance the fact that it had a higher crit rate, I suppose. But wait! They gave Chesnaught a mildly more useful Protect; Decidueye’s Spirit Shackle is also weaker than its brethren’s exclusive moves. Again, you can argue effects, I guess, but let’s just look at base power for the sake of argument. 

- Grass types generally have weaker moves. Gen 1 was a shitshow. Razor Leaf was ok with the crit rate. But if you didn’t want to waste two turns to use Solar Beam, your best bet was... Mega Drain. With 40 base power. Yay. This basically continued for many generations. Energy Ball was initially 70 base power before eventually being raised to 90. Same with Leaf Blade. And I’ll remind everyone that Water and Fire have had very powerful moves since Gen 1. 

- Grass has no niche. If water is more defensive and Fire is more offensive/speedy, Grass is left with being... a status inducer? Grass is generally apt at spreading status, but I hardly think that qualifies them for being balanced to be so trash both defensively and offensively. Especially since Poison is status oriented. And Electric types have been spreading paralysis forever. And burn was the bread and butter of Fire and Ghost types. 

- Grass has never been represented by an Elite Four member. Fire has had two representatives, while water has had a freaking champion (while still having a a gym in the same gen). While Gamefreak has historically made idiotic and repetitive decisions regarding gym and elite four typings, it’s very sad that one of the starter types has never had a representative higher than 4th gym leader. If bug can have an elite four member and basically almost a champion, then Grass can too. 

- due to the type balance, Grass is almost always the worst pick of the starter trio. This is debatable and in some cases Grass fares really well (gen 1 being the best). But generally, Grass is the worst simply due to having the most weaknesses and resisted hits. Good thing you can have 6 mons, yes, but this is just for argument’s sake. 

- They don’t exactly have great stats as a type. 

[grass type average stats](https://www.google.com/amp/s/pokemondb.net/amp/type/grass)

Look at that. Supremely low speed. And their best stat is defense, which is still in the lower 50% by one spot and again, they have issues as defensive mons. Fire types meanwhile, fare extremely well. 


So in conclusion, Gamefreak hates Grass, loves Water, is obsessed with Fire, and this would be okay if not for the fact that Grass is a starter type and I would think they would try and make starters have more parity for parity’s sake. So that you don’t feel like you’re automatically gimping yourself by choosing grass. But they haven’t for 20 years so why start now, right? 

And this is all for discussion’s sake. Obviously Pokémon should be judged individually and there are many Grass types that are great to use in-game or competitively, despite the many hurdles imposed by Gamefreak by virtue of being made a Grass type.

The issue? There are more Eevees now, and they aren’t including any of the ones that appeared later.

It’s supposed to be EEVEE version. I want a whole team of different Eevees. I understand maybe leaving out the ones that came past gen 2, but I feel upset that Espeon, and Umbreon aren’t even in the new games.  They’re just as classic as Flareon, Vaporeon, and Jolteon. Gary’s Eevee even became Umbreon in the anime.

Now we have this weird hex nut legendary when I was hoping they’d promote a new Eevee. If this were Dragon Quest, a metal ditto wouldn’t seem so out of ordinary, but this just seems.. bad for Pokémon.

If Raichu can get Alolan Raichu, then I think Eevee should of got a new evolution for Let’s Go Pikachu, and Eevee. It just doesn’t make sense to not include unique Eevee features. I’m so livid. 

Granted, the whole mysterious Pokémon go event was genius. For once we feel like the “who’s that Pokémon” thing actually feels relevant again. It’s been awhile since we ever felt motivated to go out and learn about a Pokémon like the anime does. I’m still not 100% happy though.

&gt;Name: Meltan  
&gt;  
&gt;Category: Hex Nut Pokémon  
&gt;  
&gt;Type: Steel  
&gt;  
&gt;Height: 0'08""  
&gt;  
&gt;Weight: 17.6 lbs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of Meltan’s body is made from liquid metal, and its shape is very fluid. It can use its liquid arms and legs to corrode metal and absorb it into its own body.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meltan generates electricity using the metal it absorbs from outside sources. It uses this electricity as an energy source and also as an attack that can be fired from its eye.  
&gt;  
&gt;Clearly a curious Pokémon, Meltan is very expressive and shows an interest in all kinds of things.

&amp;#x200B;

**Name origin**

Obviously Meltan's name contains the word ""melt"", a reference to its liquid metal body, and also the fact that it can melt metal and absorb them as energy.

This is just speculation, but the ""tan"" part could come from ""Galinstan"", a type of liquid metal alloy which has agressive corrosive properties which means it can corrode many other metals by dissolving them. This corresponds with the description of Meltan above, namely that it corrodes metals and absorbs them into its liquid body.

The ""tan"" could also just be the cute version of ""chan"" in Japanese, added after one's name and usually used for small kids or in an endearing way to show affection to a lover.

&amp;#x200B;

**Category**

This is obvious, Meltan's head is a hexagonal nut, commonly used as hardware fasteners. But what is strange is that Oak says Meltan is from an ancient text. Why would an ancient Pokemon have a man-made hardware object as a head? Perhaps Meltan is like Unown, in that hex nuts are in fact inspired by Meltan in the Pokemon world.

&amp;#x200B;

**Generating electricity by corrosion**

Now I'm no science person so please correct me if I'm wrong. But Meltan's ability to generate electricity by corroding metals could be the process of galvanic corrosion, which is when two metals are in physical or electrical contact and immersed in an electrolyte, causing them to corrode. The more noble metal will corrode at a slower rate (in this case Meltan's body) and take electrons from the other metal, which corrodes at a higher rate, this creates an electric current.

&amp;#x200B;

**Design**

Its silver-coloured liquid metal body resembles mercury, and galinstan actually has a similar colour as well and is sometimes used to replace mercury in thermometers. Its tail is obviously an electrical wire, I could see it using its tail to launch an electric attack, perhaps. But what's most curious is its floating eye. I have heard of the theory that its singular eyeball is in fact ferrofluid, a type of magnetic fluid that can be manipulated in a magnetic field. This theory would also explain why it can smile with its eye, which is adorable.

\~\~\~

 mentioning this on Twitter but everyone needs to remember that in Diamond and Pearl to get Manaphy you needed to

1. Buy Pokemon Ranger
2. Beat the game
3. Type in a secret code
4. Beat a mission to get the Manaphy egg
5. Have 2 Nintendo DS's present to tranfer Manaphy egg to Gen 4.

This took far more effort than what getting Meltan would probably take and you had to spend $50 on the game.

 Personally I actually like the idea of needing GO to get Meltan. When I finally got Manaphy in Gen 4 I felt the greatest sense of achievement after everything i completed to get it. In the recent Gens it also felt too straightforward to get Event Pokemon. I always found it more enjoyable to get a Ticket that would send you on a quest to capture the Event Pokemon. Overall I think this is a great feature to reward players who spend the effort, its better than locking Mew in a paywall called the PokeBall Plus.

Please provide some feedback, I'd love to hear any additions. Please try to read most of it before commenting, I tried to cover most counter-arguments already.  
Usually a heated source of debate for Pokémon fans is the difficulty of the games and how to make it more challenging. With the release of Let's Go coming out soon and a new main series game coming out later on, I've noticed a lot of people fearing alienation from the series in regards to not just mechanics, but to how much of a challenge is going to be presented.   
Obviously we would want to accommodate for all fans; those that want the hardcore, gruelling challenge, those that want a relaxed, heartwarming adventure and those that want a perfect in between. When someone wants more of a challenge with Pokémon, a nuzlocke run is usually the most applicable solution and I see a lot of people recommending nuzlockes to people who complain about breezing through the game with little thought. I also see some people wanting it as a base feature on the game but I personally find that nuzlockes have some shortcomings and aren't a great way of presenting challenge.  
First off, nuzlocke runs are entirely self-enforced. While it could be argued that this doesn't entirely make a difference, this makes the runs easier to exploit and overall not enjoyable to some. Players can grind until the threat of an opponent's Pokémon is nullified and the challenge is removed. Alongside this, some people like myself just don't enjoy self-enforced rules. They feel inhibiting and I've sometimes caught myself out on not realising a Pokémon has fainted and continued using it without realising. While it could be seen as a minor issue, it should preferably still be avoided.  
A second issue with nuzlockes is that they don't utilise a core component of what can make a Pokémon game challenging and that is the strategy of trying to outplay an opponent. The AI battles are usually very easy to exploit and read, using nonsensical moves and switches that have no effect on the outcome at all except to sometimes even screw themselves over. Difficulty should test the knowledge of battle, not just to avoid getting hit by miscellaneous critical hits.  
While having nuzlocke as a base game difficulty could help alleviate some of the issues, it doesn't help with the latter points or some other bad situations such as the rare case of getting a shiny or accidentally losing a highly trained Pokémon forever while fighting NPCs. This is where I would like to provide a solution to this that would hopefully help fix this issue, while also maintaining a casual experience for those that may not like Let's Go, but still want to play the core games.   
Firstly, the game should give the player an option on character creation to select a normal or hard difficulty. The normal mode would be the typically fashioned game of Pokémon and would allow all the usual features that would be in a core series game. The hard difficulty however, would offer a greater challenge by pitting higher leveled Pokémon against the player, an experience/level cap on your Pokémon, a smarter and more diverse AI to battle against as well as other minor features.   
An obvious limitation to this would be that a player could still cheese the game by going back and forth to a Pokémon centre. My solution to this would be to block off the escape to a town once the player has entered the route and make it available to explore properly once the player has made it to the other end, with trainers only becoming defeated upon making it to the next town. This would allow for a more careful and tactical approach to team building, where tanks and walls may be favoured over button mashing super effective moves. Items and money would become useful and invaluable instead of redundant, since they would need to be used resourcefully to ensure the route is passed. This would be a good way to make use of the resources the game has given to the player and creates new strategies and challenge within the exploration of routes. It also means the game doesn't become too overbearing with losing Pokémon and can maintain pressure while allowing players to feel at ease at not having lost the game entirely.  
To make the game flow better, experience and leveling should also be reworked to make use of the full potential of the amount of levels available. Most Pokémon games end with the player's team only reaching 50-70, which isn't that high considering they can reach 100. Much to the bane of the more competitive and thorough players, Sun and Moon was especially bad to grind up to level 100 with and while this is annoying for those who need moves from later levels, it also made the new and useful hyper training a generally huge waste of time.  
For Pokémon to maintain difficulty and to allow further flexibility for trainers, a level cap could be given before and after every gym with a Pokémon not being able to go beyond a certain experience threshold until the gym is defeated and the level cap changed. This would completely remove leveling cheese and would allow for more fair gym battles that can be focused more heavily on the actual strategy of the fight rather than the levels that each Pokémon has. For traded Pokémon, a 'true' experience gauge that can't be altered could be introduced as to not upset the campaign leveling. This would allow the Pokémon to retain its original level but function as a level capped Pokémon during the campaign. Once the player gains the required badge to see the Pokémon's level, the experience gauge would function as normal.  
My next proposition would be to remove IVs and seperate hidden powers into a random value for each type. This would still help Pokémon retain some original flair, would allow access to Fairy hidden power and would remove the desire to use action replays in VGC format. IVs were used in the past to make certain trainers harder as well as add some individuality to a Pokémon. By fully utilising levels and level caps more, they could easily tweak certain Pokémon to be higher level and therefore a larger threat. EVs as well as hidden powers would remain to give a Pokémon a unique flair and further customisability between sets just like it always has. The biggest to benefit from this would be the competitive players. If this were to happen, soft resetting for high IV legendaries, breeding for hidden power IVs and chaining dittos, all the heavily RNG reliant factors would not be a problem any more.  
However, smarter AI would be necessary to make full use of the changes. While playing Pokémon, most battles from start to finish are just making use of super effective moves to quickly finish off the opponent. Now that gyms and other trainers would be on a level playing field, it would now have the potential to test the player. Trial battles were a good way of showcasing what even some simple design can do to amplify the difficulty. While not the most challenging thing possible, trials showed that trainers needed to be prepared or risk getting swept by the totem. Simple changes to formula such as giving gym Pokémon items, coverage moves or even making them double battles would significantly help along with an AI that is able to punish mistakes. With higher levels, better AI and extra utility, gyms could be feared again just like the dreaded Goldenrod gym with Whitney instead of pushovers like the Coumarine gym with Ramos.  
With these additions, post-game activities could be freed up. With highly trained Pokémon, more options open up for further battles and challenges. For those that liked trials in place of gyms, trials could be re-included as hidden side missions on each route that provide an extra layer of difficulty. With high level Pokémon, trials of each type could be unique and challenging. Imagine an attack boosted, earthquake Garchomp being fed sandstorms and health from a support Pokémon, or a special attack boosted, trickroom supported Reuniclus in psychic terrain. The possibilities for end game trials could be fun, challenging and fresh from all the unchallenging and empty post game content of the last few games.  
Naturally, this would be a huge overhaul in mechanics and may feel jarring to those that love the current working of the game but by giving the player options to select the way they want to play, it gives even more pathways than before for all fans to enjoy. Would you rather a game like this or not?

This could mean a lot more than we think it does, in terms of new features and/or Pokemon coming to the franchise. Let's take a look at the current PoGo event.

Clearly Niantic is building Gen 1 hype for the release of Let's Go. The two games are going to be hand in hand, essentially, so this makes sense. We also have confirmed that Alolan forms will be able to be transferred to Lets Go. Looking at the current Pokemon frequently appearing in Go it's apparent that they want trainers to stock up on specific Pokemon.

Starters are appearing more for obvious Gen 1 hype.

Pokemon with Alolan forms, like Diglett, Meowth, Sandshrew, and etc, are appearing more to build candy supplies for 7km eggs, and to be transferred to Let's Go

Pokemon with gen 4, like Magnemite, Tangela, Ryhorn, etc, evolutions are appearing more for the addition of gen 4 to Go

Now, there's also several other Pokemon appearing very frequently that just seem random. Mankey, Ponyta, Abra, Machop, Bellsprout, Jigglypuff, Seel, Magikarp, Growlithe, etc. 

Looking at OrAs as a reference, it looks like Pokemon is steering towards introducing a gimmick, like mega evolution, and expanding upon it during other games that appear during that generation. This generation, we got Alolan forms.

I'm hazarding a guess that the other Pokemon appearing frequently may have new forms introduced in Let's Go. Some even line up with the early Sun and Moon leaks (Fighting Alakazam, Water Arcanine, etc.) These forms may be implemented early into PoGo, allowing trainers to transfer them to Let's Go.

Just a tin-foil hat theory, but hopefully it holds some water.",,9iu7h6,,0,,false,1540173797,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-0 formsflair missingno 10logo,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9iu7h6/meltan_pogo_and_a_new_pokemon_theory/,,G,false,Discussion,

As you know, there are 2 types of character in Pokemon: Pokemon Trainer and Pokemon Ranger.

The Pokemon Trainer catches and uses Pokemons as their own things. They see Pokemons like their private assets and sometimes they trade them with another trainer just like trading properties.

So I consider that the Pokemon Trainer represents Capitalism.

On the other hand, the Pokemon Ranger doesn't possess Pokemons, they just use them temporarily to do something in need. They don't own any Pokemon. To the Pokemon Ranger, every Pokemon is the same and the right to use them is equal between rangers. The A Ranger can use a Marill but the B Ranger can use it too.

So I consider that the Pokemon Ranger represents Communism.

It's just my idea, so if you think I was wrong, just correct me.

No any offense, just sharing my thinking.

What we do know is that it's $20 a year, and we get some retro games for that price as well as online access to games we currently have online for (free trial or whatever).

What we know about the Let's Go games is that their online capability is limited, no Wonder Trade, no GTS, no Battle Spot. But if you want to trade with your friends online, and not just locally you'll need to buy the Nintendo Online Subscription.

I believe that Pokemon is a system seller, it's a huge franchise, super popular, people by systems  to play Pokemon. It seems like not giving the Let's Go games robust online capabilities (I guess because they are more casually oriented, but I think free battles and online trading are casual friendly) isn't putting Nintendo's best foot forward when trying to advertise their online service.

What are your thoughts on the Nintendo Online Service and it's relation to Pokemon Games? I am sure Gen 8 will have full online.

So I decided to make a fair but fun version of the game for us.

I let him choose 3 Pokemon for himself and 3 Pokemon for me, and then I went to Bulbapedia and looked up their moves and I let him choose 4 moves from any of the ones I named off. Afterwards we got a D20 each and a box to throw them in, (since his rolls looked more like him throwing a poke ball) and I made up values for him to figure out who hit first, if the attack missed, if the attack crit and if there is an effect. (100% was a 20 and 5% was a 1). It was a lot of fun and he enjoyed it.

 I did give him a single full restore and a single berry that healed for 30 when I changed a Pokemon out.

Apparently i was wrong because i lost twice and it still hasnt gone on and says i need to do it. The issue? I cant win. I simply cannot. Colress' team is a Magneton, a Elgyem, and a Klink. My team is 3 of:

Affle (Psyduck) Lv32 - Water Pulse/Zen Headbutt/Screech/Confusion

Serena (Delcatty) Lv31 - Return, Attract, Sing, Work Up

Amy (Emolga) Lv30 - Shock Wave, Acrobatics, Double Team, Pursuit

Hadoo~ (Tranquill) Lv28 - Fly, Roost, Quick Attack, Leet

Glace (Glaceon) Lv30 - Ice Shard, Ice Fang, Leer, Signal Beam

Its faster than Psyduck and kills it in one hit with shock wave

All of serenas moves do like 2 damage

It quad resists every move amy has except pursuit which does 2 damage

Beats hadoo in 1 hit and resists every move

Glace dies to mirror shot very quickly


And on the very rare instances where I do kill the magneton with insane luck like psyduck living with 1 hp and me screeching it or serena singing correctly and putting it to sleep and then work up loads, the kling or the elgyem proceed to destroy me by paralyzing/confusing me so i barely ever hit.

I COULD catch a Sandile and train it. Issue there is that training the Emolga from Level 24 to Level 30 took an hour and a half, so training a Sandile from level 15ish to level 30ish would take hours and hours for something i'll use one time and then ditch.

1536240191,pokemon,OreoKirby,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9diiug/legitimate_aurora_ticket_deoxys_discovered_14/,45,227,,,Legitimate Aurora Ticket Deoxys Discovered 14 Years Later,"Hello /r/pokemon! Today I have something incredibly exciting to share with the community!

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago on **September 1st, 2018** I had a friend of mine over when he was home from college. We are both big Smash and Pokemon fans and we were talking about various things we remembered playing the games, as I  am currently running through Pokemon Crystal and had soft resetted for a shiny Cyndaquil. I had picked up a copy of an original Ruby for the reasons of soft resetting and we were talking about Gen 3 and about how Rajan still had a Deoxys from Birth Island on his copy of Emerald, that he had traded to him from is oldest brother back in 2004. *For those that do now know, there was an event in the United States in 2004 called ""Pokemon Rocks America"" that lasted 3 days where an Aurora Ticket event item for catching Deoxys was distributed to Pokemon Leaf Green and Fire Red.* I had known previously about his brother getting it from Seattle, but I didn't know the details of the event. I was explaining to him that it was still amazing that he had an Aurora Ticket event Deoxys, but because it was used and Lv. 54 it was not as rare as an untouched Lv. 30. Talking more about it, he told me that it wasn't just his oldest brother that got the event, they had gone as a family to Seattle, WA and his older brother had ALSO gotten the event. I was never told this part of the story in previous years and he was thinking about it and explaining that his other brother had probably never used it and it could be in the PC Box somewhere. I got excited and was telling him how amazing it would be if we could find it. Turns out, while he was really trying to think about it, **he could not actually remember his brother catching Deoxys at all.** I immediately got super serious telling him how insane it would be for someone to have gone to any event, especially one of the old in person ones 14 years ago, and to not have actually caught the Pokemon. This being in Generation 3, that also means it would NOT BE SHINY LOCKED. He suggested we go to his house to try to find the copy and the whole way over we were talking about just how rare this would be if this actually happened, but not to be too excited as to not disappoint ourselves..

&amp;#x200B;

When we got to his house and were searching through old drawers, he found the booklet given away at the event describing how to find and catch Deoxys in addition to the Fire Red game in question. We booted it up quite literally shaking from excitement and anticipation. *The battery was also still good!* We checked the PC Boxes, could not find the Deoxys anywhere and after that had hoped it was not traded away. We checked the key items bag and sure enough the Aurora Ticket item was there. We got to a boat and immediately traveled to Birth Island as fast as we could. We walked across the pier up to the island and sure enough.. **14 years later the Deoxys triangle was there looking back at us.**

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I jumped out of my seat running around his house in excitement screaming about how there is no way this is happening and we are probably the only copy in existence like this. After attempting to calm down I was telling him about how we had to share this with the community. We didn't have anything else other than the booklet, so I asked him if he might have had any pictures or something when they had been there. He got excited saying his mom documented a lot of their trips and we looked for a photo album. Sure enough, we found one from Seattle in 2004. We opened it up and what we found inside was also amazing. They had pictures of being at Nintendo Headquarters, a receipt buying various items from Nintendo (*Including the Gamecube DK bongos!),* an original flyer advertising the Pokemon Rocks America tour, and many pictures at the event. It's incredible to see and be sure to check it out for yourself in the album linked below. On top of that I had asked if there was any possible chance at footage and he said it was very likely that they could have a recording of the event with part of the rest of the trip. After searching downstairs we found a converted DVD of the Seattle trip. I recorded a video on my phone of our reactions and this historic moment. A link below also includes the raw footage they had from the event in 2004. After that we did our best to record some footage and take pictures of everything we could find.

I can't express how amazing this is and I hope those of you that knew about the old events and even those who didn't can also appreciate this crazy discovery. I made a video describing the event and our story, be sure to check that out if you are interested in more information or a visual. [On September 10th at 6:00PM EST I will be attempting to stream soft resetting for what I think may be the first authentic Shiny Deoxys ever recorded.](https://www.twitch.tv/oreokirby) I hope anyone that read my novel here enjoyed our story and please join us on Monday if you wanted to be part of this story!

And since it is possible to emulate on mobile already, and we see all these copy-cat games already, why haven’t they capitalized on this yet? 

I’ve seen the argument for virtual console that there would be no way to trade or battle because the console would be at home but we keep our phones on us at all times and the technology exists with Pokémon Go and all the copy-cat games. I don’t know, just a thought that popped in my head.

The link will be further down below.

The questions are as follows:

* What previous main series Pokemon games have you played?
* Are you excited for Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee?
* What do you like about Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee based on information we have?
* What do you dislike about Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee based on information we have?
* What would you like to see carried into future mainline games (2019+) from Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee?
* Would you like to see more games in the Let's Go format in the future?

And that's it! It shouldn't take any longer than 10 minutes to fill out, potentially 15 on mobile as most of the questions are checkbox-related and may require scrolling.

For disclosure, based on your answer to ""Are you excited for Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee?"" you will be taken to a differing version of all future questions in order to get a better idea of why people *are* why people *aren't* excited for the games.

I also have an identical poll on the Nintendo Switch subreddit to gauge differences in opinions between this community and that of the Switch subreddit!

If you haven't been bored to death and are still interested in taking the survey, [then please click right here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFHxJsK4D6_c0IRqPjqBtVAPBLZuwdcZhpg6ScfKPSO0ysAw/viewform)

Results will be posted in approximately two weeks. The separated results for each question will be posted, as well as the overall averages.

for XY, it is announced through the pokemon direct, so many people are watching at the same time. there isn't those ""is it for real"" moment like ORAS which had no prior announcement. and for SM, the titles and logo are leaked a few days before the pokemon direct which does not make the announcement as hyped.

I'm getting into pokemon and building a team all the way from old GBA games and going up to newer ones so i was wondering, what makes a good moveset good?

-Let's say i have a Whiscash, which is Water/Ground and is Attack and HP EV trained Pokemon. Do i use 2 moves of Water and Ground type to get the STAB bonus or is there something else to it?

-What do you suggest for other 2 move slots, based on a Pokemon's role, for example attackers having a stat increasing move and stallers having a status move or something like that?

-For the last move slot i have no idea what to consider, no matter the pokemon, i figured 2 attacking moves grabbing the stab bonus, 1 stat increasing/status move and that leaves just the last one.

Mind you, I never actually played any of the newer games after emerald, and the reason for that was simply that the newer Pokemon designs seemed so out of place, needlessly complicated/abstract, or too flashy/convoluted for my tastes, and as a result I have had great difficulty relating to them relative to all previous generations designs which, more often than not, shared a common design schema. The older designs were far more subtle and easy to ""read"" from an artistic perspective, in other words you could quickly indentify the pokemon's functionality/demeanor almost immediately after seeing it. The new designs, gen 4+, just seem so hard to indentify, my eyes keep searching for some kind of familiarity, anything to make sense out of these almost alien looking ""Pokemon"", but to no avail. It's like I can't just look at a Pokemon and know if it's powerful or not anymore or explain its purpose/place within the hierarchy of other Pokemon in its region.

Now if the designs got better I would totally play the games, but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen anytime soon. And don't even get me started on this ""mega evolution"" sacrilege!

This got me thinking of the subject of this post. Pokemon music is one of the greatest influences that has factored in my decision to become a professional musician.

That would be a really nice job to have."", fast-forward 10 years later, and I'm writing the music for a Pokemon fangame. Funny how that works out.

It could use the capture mechanics we are all use to, remove the Pokémon Go wild Pokémon remix and act just like a core game even allowing you to transfer Pokémon not in Gen 1 though the PokéBank, essentially being a remake of Pokémon Yellow?

&gt;Came to the Kanto region through some mysterious force

Some of the trailers show parts of the cinematic that plays when the main character gets its starter, and there's some mysterious light involved, and Oak, the MC and the rival all look shocked at something that's apparently related to the Balls where the starters are in.

I've theorized a few times since those trailers that the Eevee and Pikachu starters were not supposed to be the main character's starter, but that when they go to choose one of the classic three, something weird happens and Eevee or Pikachu appear instead.

This phrase in the screenshot makes it all but official, at this point.

**EDIT:** There's actually a video of that moment, though the scene seems to be chopped in pieces in the demo they played: https://youtu.be/Uu7BSD4JXsc

So, maybe these Eevee and Pikachu are not from the main character's world? Which would probably mean they've traveled through the Ultra Space somehow? Didn't pokémon that got exposed to high levels of Ultra Space energy get an aura that increased their stats and abilities? Like Totem pokémon or UBs?

Maybe that's one explanation to why this Pikachu and this Eevee in particular are so strong even if unevolved.",,9jl9tr,,0,,false,1540186425,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-2 alolaflair 724,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jl9tr/are_the_lets_go_starters_totem_pokémon/,,I am the night!,false,Discussion,

I mean, in Sugimori's first official artworks all the Pokemon already look pretty much exactly as we know them today, but the question is: were those artworks already available before/during the development of these games? If this was the case, then it must have been done on purpose (or perhaps due to a lack of resources/commitment, as already mentioned), and if not, then this would suggest that the designs were still in the process of coming to life, even with/after the games' release, right?

There is a general consensus that in Pokemon Yellow all the sprites are based on Anime portrayals, which, however, hardly differ from Sugimori's depictions IMO. So it seems to me that the sprites in this game were not exclusively influenced by the Anime, but rather by all the rapid developments within the entire Pokemon brand and its rising popularity, which ultimately forced the people involved in Pokemon portrayals to make them look more proper and uniform. This would also explain why the sprites were somewhat changed in the following Red/Blue releases (or just Blue in Japan), even though this wouldn't have been necessary from a purely technical point of view (the main point of the re-release was a technical overhaul due to the first games' fragile state).

So to sum up, it would be interesting to know whether this change in sprites happened only because the Pokemon brand was getting more important, or because the sprites/artworks weren't yet properly developed by the time Red/Green were released in Japan (or perhaps a combination of both).",,9jmy33,,0,,false,1540187193,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-8 kantoflair 9,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jmy33/whats_the_story_behind_greenreds_deformed_pokemon/,,Blastoise is great ;),false,Discussion,

With both of those in mind (and after watching plenty of the anime) I thought of a really fun idea.

I'm going to take my group of six core pokemon, and play through all of the generations. Of course I'll have to breed new ones for each game (which won't take that long) but this way I can travel through all the regions with my core team super similar to the show. 

I'll obviously have to make some adjustments as some pokemon won't be accessible until later on (generation wise) but the idea of traveling through all of the regions with just one team (possibly nuzlocking it) just sounded to fucking good to pass up. 

Let me know what you guys think of this.",,9jozby,,0,,false,1540188160,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9jozby/new_pokemon_play_through_idea_i_thought_id_mention/,,,false,Discussion,

I've played from Gen 1 through Gen 5 - so I'm sorry I don't connect with everyone over the mega evolutions!

&amp;#x200B;

I was curious why Nintendo dropped WiFi support for Gen 4, and why they wouldn't consider picking it back up. I understand their are some tech challenges with DSes connecting to WiFi, but if there are some old modems laying around that can hook DSes up, I don't understand why not. The interest in playing Gen 4 still seems to be there for a certain (maybe even large) amount of the fan base (I personally have several friends who wish they could play with me long distance but alas we cannot). Any thoughts or comments on this? I haven't kept up with the Pokenews as much, so this is just as much for my education (and anyone else's on the subject) as it is for a discussion about the viability of WiFi support again.

There's no hiding the fact that some pokemon are just used far more often than other pokemon. Give a pokemon you think has been used by everyone (and if you want, a good reasoning on why it would be so used) and if you see one that you've never used listed let it be known. Obviously if you havent played all the games and therefore literally could not have used some of these pokemon, just stick to the games you have played.

In my opinion, the pokemon that was likely used by everyone is probably the Shinx line. Shinx is very cute and Luxray is badass looking so there's appeal for everyone. Plus Shinx's are very numerous in Sinnoh, you run into them all the time so there is plenty of opportunity to catch one. It's a solid pokemon and Electric type is always topping the list for desired types for a team. It also only helps its case by being available so early in the game, which causes players to get attached early on, rather than finding a different electric type later and switching it out.",,9dr1x7,,0,,false,1540088071,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9dr1x7/is_there_any_pokemon_that_has_been_used_on_a_team/,,,false,Discussion,

It's my first time posting here and I wanted to get some more detailed opinions on questions that I have concerning generations 6 and 7. Currently, I'm thinking about buying Pokemon Y and Pokemon Ultra Sun. I've played all the generations since I was a kid up until generation 5 and I wanted to catch up since I have the money to afford a new Nintendo 2DS XL as of this moment ($129.99 at Target; Y and Ultra Sun are on sale too!). I've already tried searching for posts relating to this topic but I haven't been having a lot of success with Reddit's search functionality. From what I have seen, some people say that Y and Ultra Sun were ""disappointments"" and a lot of these comments have me slightly worried about upgrading to the new generation and have caused me to have some questions out of curiosity. So I was wondering:

* If I haven't played Sun, would it be advisable to simply skip to Ultra Sun instead? 
* I've been trying to actively avoid spoilers in regards to the story and from what I have gleaned online, it seems that Ultra Sun's story was worse and in some instances ""butchered""? 
   * How much of a downgrade is the story in this case? 
   * Are we talking about minor story changes or does it make the plot significantly less enjoyable and memorable? 
   * Or are the plot changes just a \~1% difference in the overall quality of the plot? 
   * Is the story in Ultra Sun on the level of Black and White? (I really enjoyed the plot of Black and White and the allusions to philosophy.)
   *  Do these changes make Ultra Sun a worse game than Sun? 
* Is it better to play through Y and then Ultra Sun to familiarize myself with generation 6 mechanics first?

I've been waiting a long time to catch up to these generations but it seems like there's a lot of negativity surrounding generations 6 and 7 online and at times, it's been giving me second thoughts. I love this franchise and I grew up with generations 3 and 4. Recently this summer, I have been catching up with generation 1, 2, and 5 games. Ultimately, do you guys think it's worth it to catch up to the new generations? I was wholeheartedly set on getting Y and Ultra Sun but a lot of other fan's feelings have caused me to have worries. If I had a choice, would Sun or Ultra Sun be the game to buy? I know there are a lot of questions here and feel free to answer as few or as many as you would like!

Me: ""Well I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that. I think IVs could be overhauled or just make hyper training accessible at any level-

Guy: ""No like the entire battle system needs to change.""

Me: Wait but why? The battle system is arguably one of the most iconic things about Pokemon outside of the Pokemon themselves. It's very easy and simple to get into while still having enough layers to it to have a whole metagame around.

Guy: ""It needs to change because turn-based combat isn't as popular as it once was""

Me: they may not be as plentiful as they were now in days but excluding pokemon games like Octopath Traveler, Dragon Quest, Bravely Default, and more are still received fairly well by the general public.

Guy: ""But really think about it would you like to play an a open world Pokemon game with action RPG elements?""

Me: I mean it really depends on how the game is made. Also an open world Pokemon game with action RPG elements sounds like a nightmare to develop. They would have to program hitboxes for like every Pokemon. Doesn't that sound a little bit tedious?

Guy: ""Yeah but it shows that game freak would finally put effort into their games, instead of using the same rehash tired formula""

Me: If by effort do you mean overly ambitious, then I suppose. This project sounds really overly ambitious  and tedious for any developer to tackle.

Team Rocket

The mob. They take Pokémon for profit, getting rid of anyone who gets in their way. From what I know, that's how mafias operate.

Team Magma and Aqua

Extremists, something close to Eco-terrorists. I mean, they have a good reason for the stuff they are doing and are aware of the consequences.

Team Galaxy

Doomsday Cult. Its has the terrorism tactics of Aum Shinrikyo, the charismatic leader resembling David Koresh and Jim Jones, and the universe-ending lore of Heaven's Gate.

Team Plasma

The Civil War American South(Ghetsis' Plasma), mixed with a bit of PETA(N's Plasma). I like to think of N as Abraham Lincoln, as both freed those who were enslaved(black slaves and Pokémon).

Team Flare

Nazis. They want to create their own twisted 'beautiful world' and use a WOMD in doing so(remember, Nazis developed nukes). And Kalos is based on France-remember who got trampled by Nazi Germany? Exactly.

Team Skull

A mix of various American street gangs, plus a pinch of corporate-funded gang stories(remember Robocop 1980s?).

Aether Foundation

Evil corporations...yeah, that's a bit open, but I don't know too much about evil corps.

What's your opinion? Please, comment below!",,9dtzij,,0,,false,1540089431,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9dtzij/how_i_understand_pokemon_villains/,,,false,Discussion,

Need some suggestions.,"So yesterday I finally beat the champion in black 2. Usually at this point in the game I have a good idea about what my final party will be but in this case I'm kinda lost.

Here's the Pokemon I'm sure about:

- samurott 
- chandelure
- haxorus

As for the other three I really have no idea hence this post. I'd love some recommendations on who to use.

- I need a flying Pokemon that can learn fly that isn't unfezant.

- an electric type. I was thinking maybe emolga but maybe it's a bad choice??

- and lastly a dark type. I wanted krookodile but I already used it in the first Black game so ehh. I might end up using it again since its so good.

So yeah, would love your feedback. Thanks in advance.",,9duy9d,,0,,false,1540089890,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9duy9d/good_team_for_pokemon_black_2_endgame_need_some/,,,false,Discussion,

Prior to that, none were found and the only Pokémon obtainable by the main character were snagged. A player in-game mentions that the lack of Pokémon is due to the arid climate of Orre, but we see wild Pokémon living in arid climates in other regions such as the sandstorm area of Hoenn, and we also know that Orre contains more fertile areas such as Agate Village. Maybe it has to do with the existence of shadow Pokémon, which as far as we know, are present in no other region. I’d love to hear any theories!

Being more attached to my Pokemon may bring me a side of this game I've never seen before, and I think that could be really fun. Another reality of it could be, however, that the pace of the game and duration of the hunts could be a complete turn off.

Wishiwashi: Looks cool in school form and I can potentially catch one at level 20

Octillery: Can catch remoraid rn and octillery is one of my favorite pokemon concept-wise but haven't used one yet. Stats a bit meh tho

I was a gigantic fan all my life, and didn’t care that I was about to be a 22 year old playing Pokémon (which I must say is a very liberating thought). My. God. Ultra Sun is one of the most fun video games I have ever played. I’ve been in a rut for a while now, and while this really isn’t doing anything to get me out of it, it’s been a pleasant distraction from the ugliness this world has been churning out lately. It’s bright. It’s colorful. It’s funny. It’s challenging at times (which I did not expect yet adore because that’s what made the old games so rewarding). I love it. The story driven plot line makes me really feel like I’m on an adventure, as well as forces you to form a bond with your team, which are ultimately a group of pixels on a gameboy screen.

Have any of you come up with or heard cool Pokemon info that isn't canon? I'd love to hear them and write them down (I'll keep your name along with it if I ever decide to post the lore and credit you) 
If you would rather have me not using your ideas anywhere, tell me so!

I can also tell you what I've written about certain pokemon already. If interested, ask in the comments and I'll reply with anything I have.



For example, something I wrote awhile ago:

Houndoom's ""bracelets"" are impractical, but give a sense of cohesion. Rather than being taught how to hunt, a Houndour is first taught how to produce it's fires engulfed in acid and how to use it. 

It is the mother's job to teach it's offsprings, but males can do it too, if females aren't around. A Houndour is only a true member of a pack, when it has burned scrap metal around it's legs, which eventually cools down and becomes something like that of neat jewelry. When the pup grows into a Houndoom, it will create the next set of metal rings. 

Houndooms are often seen with two layers of these ""bracelets"", but it's rumored that pack leaders create even more. 

Because of all this, scrap metal is allowed to be left in the wild in certain routes, so these Pokemon have less of a need to come into towns and cities. That would be bad for both us and them, as these crafts are valuable and people can secretly hunt these creatures just to obtain them and sell them on the black market.

Pokémon Dash was a small but very fun part of my life. Though, when I was a bit younger, I had lots of trouble succeeding in the harder races, it has brought a lot of joy into my childhood. My absolutely favourite feature of the game was actually the title screen - where you were able to stretch Pikachu's face.

It was actually the first Pokémon game released for the Nintendo DS, being followed by Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl two years after. Personally, it was quite the challenge for me to use the stylus effectively for winning. The difficulty isn't really fitting for children, but it is fun anyway.

Having remembered this game and researched it a bit just for fun, I think I will dig out that game whereever it might be now and probably give the races another try \^\^

In GO, Candy is species-specific and is the only way to level up and evolve our mons, and it's obtained by catching more mons of that same species.

In Let's Go, Candy doesn't level up or evolve your pokémon (except the well-known Rare Candy, of course), and instead it boosts your pokémon's stats. Most types of Candy in Let's Go are tied to a certain stat: Quick Candy, for instance, raises your mon's Speed.

Which means, Candy is a new way to EV train our pokémon. Instead of (or in addition to?) getting automatic EV boosts by fainting wild mons, we get those points in the shape of Candy and we can use them with the pokémon we want, to boost the stat of our choice.

The way to obtain Candy in Let's Go is by catching and transferring to Prof Oak heaps of wild mons, but that's just another GO reminiscence.

In my opinion, it'd be an awesome addition if for Gen 8 Gamefreak got rid of the EVs you get from battling, and instead created a system similar to Candy (even if it goes by other name or they're obtained somehow else), so we can have more control on our EV training.",,9h6c6e,,0,,false,1540145761,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-2 alolaflair 724,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9h6c6e/why_the_new_candy_system_in_lets_go_is_an_awesome/,,I am the night!,false,Discussion,

&amp;#x200B;

I dusted off my Pokemon XD and started a new game.  
I would like to discuss team recommendations, strategies and overall discussions about the game.  


I wanted to go for a good and unique team, avoiding the usual top tiers and legendaries.  
Here's my team so far  
Jolteon (Magnet), fast sweeper, ELCTR is god coverage for the usual Orre encounter and useful to paralyze shadow pkm  
\&gt;thunderbolt  
\&gt;thunder  
\&gt;thunderwave  
\&gt;bite (throwaway move, recommendations ?)  


Dewgong (Mystic Water), decided on him over Walrein despite the overall stats because of Surf, Sheer Cold and better Sp.Def. Amazing coverage, with a few levels ahead, lots of OHKOs  
\&gt;Surf  
\&gt;Ice Beam  
\&gt;Rain Dance (setup Jolteon's Thunder)  
\&gt;Sheer Cold  


Muk (Poison Barb), great on offense and awesome wall  
\&gt;Sludge Bomb  
\&gt;Brick Break  
\&gt;Acid Armor  
\&gt;Minimize  


Dusclops (Leftovers), defeated Gorigan single-handedly (yes, I went and fought Gorigan with only him in my party)  
\&gt;Shadow Ball (Psychic coverage)  
\&gt;Curse  
\&gt;Confuse Ray  
\&gt;Helping Hand (amazing in double battles)  
I was thinking of teaching him Psychic or WoW but I like HH in double battles and I think it would be a bad idea to get rid of Shadow Ball  


Houndoom (Blackglasses, to cover Psychic types better), decided on him over Arcanine despite lower stats because of higher Sp.Atk.  
\&gt;Flamethrower  
\&gt;Faint Attack  
\&gt;Roar (usefull in a bad matchup) (throwaway move)  
\&gt;Fire blast (throwaway move)  
any better move recommendations ?  


I'm still not sure on the sixth member. I was thinking about Primeape and giving him Earthquake. Right now I'm using the NPC's traded Electabuzz for it's versatility.  


I was also thinking of swapping Houdoom for a pokemon with better synergy with the team, despite the risk of not having a fire type, any ideas ?  


I just finished Colosseum and can't wait to take on the Colosseums with Ho-Oh and Lugia.  


Finally, any tips for the Orre Colosseum ? ",,9h7t2t,,0,,false,1540146446,false,spoiler,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9h7t2t/pokemon_xd_discussion/,,,false,Discussion,

Im gonna buy lets go eevee, and im gonna buy gen 8 games. But i can tell you guys that pokemon stadium on the switch would probably be one of the most beautiful things we could ever get.

Think of the different battles in a battle frontier style and tournament style, the versus mode, the gym battles plus the elite four (guess it would be gen 8 or kantos elite) think of the holy blessed mini games you can play with family and friends, the professor oak lab, the library (which could include info about how IVs and EVs work along with helping people understand how to play pokemon even better or towards competitive), think of the beautiful animations they had in stadium of pokemon blasting and shooting their moves with actual impact and getting flung or looking real hurt from the impact (seriously the animations back then were stellar) and, most importantly, the AWESOME COMMENTATOR, that man will forever be in my heart as someone who could make pokemon sound even more amazing than what it already was.

just consider it for a moment how insanely amazing that would be

course it probs wont lol

So Bulbasaur -&gt; Ivysaur -&gt; Venusaur -&gt; Squirtle, etc. I think that it would make the game really dynamic because your party would be constantly changing. 

The way moves would work would involve either a Pokemon learning a standard set each time it evolved (a smogon set or maybe just the last four moves that it would have learned in its move pool) or the player would have full access to any four moves in a Pokemon's movepool once it evolves.

This would add new levels of strategy to the game, like looking ahead in the Dex to be sure that their team wouldn't become all one type of Pokemon, SpAtk/Atk'ers, or support 'mons at once. Also you shouldn't be able to prevent a Pokemon from evolving because that would spoil the fun ;P

Conceptually I would think that this would be a very easy game to make because the main gimmick would just involve changing the level that a Pokemon evolves and what it evolves into.

The inspiration for this run came from Jrose11's video ""Is it Possible to Beat Pokemon Red/Blue with Just a Magikarp?"" 

These are the rules for this run

1. You can only use one Magikarp, no evolutions or multiple Magikarps in your party are allowed. You may catch Pokemon to be HM slaves to progress the story

2. If you have another Pokemon in your party and run into a Pokemon that can use roar to swap out your Pokemon, you must restart the battle. So make sure that you only keep your HM Pokemon with you when you need them!

3. Save states are allowed, but not in mid battle. This rule is something that I would like to potentially abolish in the future, but would be incredibly difficult to do without. I didn't use save states in the beginning of this run, but ran into a problem where I would lose battles, and also lose all of my money, which also greatly reduces the speed of this run. But I figured if you save before a battle and lose, you could just as easily reset and try again as you could on any Game Boy. 

4. You may use items during battle such as X Attack, Dire Hit, etc etc. 

5. No glitches of any kind are allowed. 

6. Silly names are not required, but are encouraged! 

I began the run by hacking a Magikarp into the beginning of the game after choosing Cyndaquil (Because your rival will counter with Tododile.) The only other issue with your rival, is that he obtains a Ghastly along the way, so if you want to beat him, you have to use a dang'ole struggle sweep! (Or elixers, but those will be important later on.) 

So far, one of the most troubling parts of this run, was fighting against Morty, the all ghost type gym leader. Since you can only attack ghost pokemon with struggle as Magikarp, it took me about 3 hours of training and getting good rng to take him down when I got to his gym. 

As of right now, I have just beat the 8th gym, and am on my way to the Pokemon League. I've spent countless hours training my Magikarp up to its current level of 62, which I know will still not be enough to take on the Elite 4. This week will consist of constant training and mental preparation for the oncoming battles.  So far, I have put about 40 hours of in game time on this run, and am expecting much more to come!

If you'd like to see my current run of this game, I stream it every day on twitch around 8-10PM EST

Based on a super successful event we've been hosting on [our partnered Discord server](http://www.discord.gg/pokemon), we're back with another round of **Mystery 'Mon Mondays!!** Much like the popular TV show commercial break special, *Who's That Pokémon?*, it will be your job to tell us the mystery Pokémon... BUT WITH A TWIST!

Every Monday morning we'll post a cropped section of a Pokémon. Here are the rules:

* The cropped section will be from an official rendering of the Pokémon. This could be Sugimori art, Dream World art, a sprite, TCG art, or any other piece of official art.
* The cropped section will have a filter applied to it to distort it just a bit. This filter may alter the color just a *slight* bit, but we don't mess with stuff like the rotation or saturation.
* The Pokémon may or may not be shiny. If it's shiny, you will need to specify that in your guess.
* If the Pokémon has multiple forms, you will need to specify the form in your guess.
* At the end of the day we'll award users who guess correctly one point on our scoreboard.
* Once you've submitted a guess for the week's picture, you cannot submit a second one.
* **Users with 5 correct guesses will earn themselves a nifty ball-flair**

## Submit your guess as a one word answer [in this Direct Message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Mystery-Mon&amp;subject=Mystery+%27Mon+%2335)

Please note that we've been informed that there have been some issues with the bot not working right. We hope to have these issues fixed soon, but we'll also be checking PMs sent to the /u/Mystery-Mon account in the meantime. Once the bot's fixed, we'll also recheck past weeks' entries to make sure we've got them all counted correctly!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple ideas that I think would work as options.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scaling Trainer levels and pokemon team team size to player progress
2. Adding in rotating squads of pokemon for trainers to ""draft""  their teams from
3. Adding in better IV/EV stats for Trainers
4. Reducing exp and EV gain until you beat the Elite 4
5. Add in an official Nuzlocke mode with hard coded restrictions.

Some of these I like better than others. I think it wouldn't be that difficult to scale trainers' and even wild Pokemon levels the current highest level Pokemon on a player's team. This would prevent over leveling, and in the case of trainers, if EV's also improved it could actually prove detrimental to a small extent to just level your pokemon with no regard to its stat growth.

&amp;#x200B;

However I do recognize that a lot of the games easy play comes from the predictability of the opponent's teams. Most trainers you meet on the road only have a couple Pokemon, and even the later Gym Leaders and Kahunas have fixed teams you can  tackle with the right type match ups with little other regard to strategy. So idea number 2 is having ""box"" Pokemon for the AI to pull from, say for example Lance has 12 or 18 Dragon type Pokemon to pull from, and a couple different roster layouts, the secondary typing will make things a bit more unpredictable and require players to have a more solid strategy than just ""load it up with Ice attacks"". I recognize the downside to this is the effort it would take to add the additional team rosters to the game.

&amp;#x200B;

The last option is preventing grind by reducing Exp and EV gain until you beat the Elite 4, but I don't think  that would actually increase difficulty and just make things grindier so I don't think it's worth elaborating on.

&amp;#x200B;

Something I don't think Nintendo will do but would be kind of funny would be adding in all the Nuzlocke restrictions as a hard mode.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally in my head a theoretical hardmode campaign would be a mix of the first 3 options, requiring more and more thought into the teams we build and how we raise our Pokemon during the core single player games. This would increase the overall challenge for single player mode as well as help bridge the gap into post game content and multiplayer. I know that AI will never be as challenging as other players, but I would love it if the next step Pokemon took into Gen 8 was adding some sort of Hard Mode for the games.

&amp;#x200B;

Later evolutions like in gens II and IV, and mega evolutions are two big avenues of creativity I’d like to see more of, but specifically now, I’d like to speculate about developing regional variants.

With the gen IV remakes possibly on the way, I’d like to introduce an idea; sinnoh forms. I would kill to see sinnoh regional variants.

You could dip into the existing sinnoh Pokédex to try and make some regional forms, maybe a sinnoh machop or swablu line (I like electric/fighting and ice/dragon typings respectively).

At the same time, you could look forward to later gens and make regional variants of those Pokémon specifically for sinnoh.  Imagine a sinnoh form lillipup line, or maybe even a more exciting line like sinnoh noibat and noivern.

It would even be cool to create regional variants for certain characters to use. Give Cyrus with a sinnoh form crobat, or Cynthia a sinnoh form milotic. I’m not sure exactly how the typings would be different, but this could give boss battles some extra sinnoh flair.

Regional forms is one of my favorite new features of the games and I really don’t want Alola to be the first and last region that utilizes them.

Whereas Dawn and especially Serena came across as performers mixing contest techniques, May used more straightforward battling in her Contests and her appeals tended to be very simple. Obviously some of this is just because the animation of the anime improved over time (Hoenn's animation was only marginally better than the original series, whereas DP and especially XY got more visually creative/impressive), but it's noticeable.

The other thing, as we know, is most of Ash's female companions barely battle in the anime in general. Misty very rarely battled in the original series, and most of it was just Psyduck popping out of its ball till around mid/late Johto. Iris had some battles in the Don battle tournaments, but not much otherwise. And Serena and the SM girls just barely battle in general. Dawn had a lot of battles outside of Contests too, but again she mostly went for visual flair and contest techniques with her battles. 

Meanwhile May has the second most amount of on-screen battles for a travel companion after Dawn, and almost all her Contest battles were won by her KOing her opponent with sheer force like it was a Gym battle. May also wearing her normal clothes in Contests and not putting on a dress like Dawn/Serena did back in Hoenn also gave her this vibe.

Besides that she has the most amount of evolutions on her team especially as seen when she returned in her DP cameo. While she may never appear in the anime again, it's also possible she has a Mega Blaziken now similar to Misty/Brock getting Mega's.

It's just rather noticeable that May along with Dawn have the most battles, but May felt more like a trainer than coordinator so it stuck out this way.",,9f4gpi,,0,,false,1540111134,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9f4gpi/was_may_the_closest_thing_to_a_female_battler_we/,,,false,Discussion,

This didn't occur to me initially while playing Pokémon Moon, but became abundantly clear once I fired up Soul Silver for a replay session. 

In the first generation games, many of the trainers you encounter on your journey use Pokémon that aren't  necessarily powerful (I'm looking at you Fisherman Earl with your three level 15 Magikarps, as well as you Rocket Grunt 27 with your team of five level 23 Rattata).  This never bothered me when I played those games at first, but I noticed that Sun and Moon don't do this, at all! Almost every trainer you encounter has one, sometimes two Pokémon that are generally the same level as your Pokémon and will often give you quite a hard time. I can't remember exacly where this was, but I remember having my team completed finished off by some guy's Espeon rather early in the game. This applies to wild Pokémon as well. Most patches of grass you come across will have Pokémon that are somewhat the same level as yours. 

I thought this was incredibly refreshing, but honestly, made the earlier games feel like much more of a grind sometimes and at occasions become plain boring (Rocket hideout). I still enjoy them and Pokémon Emerald might still be me favorite game in the series, but I'd thought I'd share to see if anyone else noticed this as well.

The Pokémon universe being shrouded in mystery and onimous vibes has been one of the greatest reasons I love this series.  

But I feel like a game which literally introduces the gods of the said universe along with a nihilistic villain outshines the experiences in the latter games.    

The concepts in D/P/Pt sound something you'll probably find in the final installment of the series.  

I feel like if you don't play D/P/Pt, the series seems to have more flow. In Hoenn, we meet pokémon who rule the Earth, later we meet entities like Deoxys who are from other worlds, then in Alola with the introduction of Ultra Worlds, we discovered Pokémon from other dimensions. Eventually everything would lead to the final game where me meet God of the Pokémon universe.

I dunno if anyone has mentioned this idea before but I have been playing through pokemon red and is easy with standard nuzlocke rules.

So i decided to make it 10x harder. so these are the extra rules i apply to my nuzlocke to make it a challenge in pokemon red.

Rule 1. Standard nuzlocke rules ;)

Rule 2. Cannot use items / Potions inside battle (Except pokeballs)

Rule 3. When defeated a gym,Rival or Giovanni you must release a pokemon. ( This Rule here makes is alot harder since you have to Think about who you need to future battle more.)

Rule 4. You cannot switch pokemon From pc. If you do you have to release one pokemon in order for you to obtain it out of pc box.

Rule 5. You have to play on set mode.

Rule 6. You cannot use any Static pokemon. ( So no Snorlax, Evee's , Legendarys, Traded evolution, Brought pokemon from game corner, Hitmonlee/chan, Lapras.)
This rules makes it alot harder as well so you cannot just buy abra to sweep gyms etc.

Rule 7. No OHK0 Tm's ;)

Rule 8. Your Pokemon cannot be higher level than the next gym leaders highest level pokemon. Elite 4 is Lances highest pokemon).

That is it, You can defiantly use this for other pokemon games normally if playing on other versions i use same rules but where Giovanni is put another main character / Boss ( Like Pokemon Rubies Archie.)

Thank you hopefully you can make ur nuzlocke alot harder This way and is more fun. You can also make it harder by not using tm's but my theory behind that is you are restricted by what pokemon you use more than normal nuzlocke.

Also if you are instrested i have a tier list for hardcore nuzlocke ;) Hope you enjoy. Please give me feedback.

But I've figured it out; it's not that its head is stupid. It's that it's body is.

Think about it; its head is way too big for its skinny little body. So why didn't they make it a little chubbier? It could've been given a higher defence stat and lose some of its speed, and it would've worked lore-wise, considering the idea of Alolan Persian was that it was the Pokemon of royals. It wouldn't have had to move around much and had an easy life, so naturally, it'd get fatter.

They have high-tech, operate outside of the law, and have seemingly endless funds despite little-to-no income and repeated failures (like the CIA).

One of the things I've always wondered: why does the government allow Team Rocket to operate?

Well, team rocket is attempting to create a super-race of Pokemon to further their own goals, while allowing a servile sub-race of pokemon as 'slaves'.  They are, in addition, doing various experiments and mutations.

By doing this, they can have a 'master class' of pokemon to fight their battles and keep the lesser pokemon in-line, while having all their daily needs met and being able to live like Pharaohs.  

How else can you explain the lack of government intervention and the seemingly endless funds and high-tech of team rocket?",,9f9y0l,,0,,false,1540113719,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9f9y0l/team_rocket_the_black_ops_of_pokemon/,,,false,Discussion,

I've realized a few trends most of my runs tend to have that I'd like to work against.

First off, I tend to use primarily Pokemon from earlier generations. Heck, the team I used for Moon had only my starter as the sole Alolan pokemon, unless you count an Alolan Raichu. So, right off the bat we have rule #1: Only new Pokemon (So hey, it'll be like Unova all over again)

Secondly, I tend to make my team early on, and while I keep collecting as I go through the run I rarely ever add anything new to my team once I'm established. So many Pokemon that I'm sure are neat in their own way just go unused. This is the rule I'm having more trouble coming up with.

I'm thinking a rule where I can only use the six most recent Pokemon I've come across. But as this is more to force variety rather than for challenge I'd rather not paint myself into a corner if, say, all the Pokemon in a route are ineffective against the next gym. I'd also wish to encourage myself to use their evolutions as well, which may mean coming back to something I caught on the first route once it's viable to evolve it.

Any thoughts on what sort of rules I can make for the second?",,9fa8id,,0,,false,1540113844,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,0-26 kantoflair 27,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9fa8id/considering_a_new_run_style_for_next_generation/,,Urthdigger,false,Discussion,
1536779050,pokemon,Edosox,self.pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9fand7/three_things_pokémon_could_learn_from_xenoblade/,11,6,,,Three things Pokémon could learn from Xenoblade Chronicles 2,"#1. Open, explorable areas. 

The biggest point, the one I'd like to start off with. 

Xenoblade Chronicles 2 features large, open areas with quite a few different pathways, subareas and secrets. Populations of monsters roaming freely throughout different sections of the map. These areas are far more grand and impressive than the linear pathways that we've been stuck with the past seven generations. 

Some of these subsections are found by discovery, some are for later in the game, and some are found by using your blades's overworld abilities. The last one being something that could be translated well into Pokémon given all the different species and distinct characteristics. 


One interesting advantage seen in Xenoblade is that there are monsters higher level than the player in certain areas. What this means is that you have an additional gameplay obstacle in the form of high-level monsters which you must think about avoiding. This enhances the game by meaning you can't just charge into things, and there is a sense of danger. Another significant benefit is that it means that lower level regions can have areas only accessible at higher levels, which provides an incentive to go back.


Instead of the archaic process of repeatedly mashing the D-pad in order to trigger an encounter, the player could simply survey the relevant areas for the specific Pokémon, and the related tasks that could be associated with it. It's infinitely more natural and flexible in this way. 


Xenoblade  is an RPG, with monster encounters taking place in the overworld. These fights are frequently as long or longer than wild Pokémon encounters tend to be. This is clear enough proof that Pokémon make sense in the overworld and there is no issue having battles take place here as well. 

Overall Pokémon I think would clearly benefit from using this level design strategy.


#2. Merc Group

In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, blades are very much an equivalent of Pokémon. They're used in battle, are collectible, have different stats and abilities and can be earned in different ways.

In Pokémon you frequently catch more Pokémon than you can reasonably use in a playthrough (6 + a small bit more if you cycle through them). This often leaves them sitting in a box, not really benefiting the main game experience significantly. Pokémon caught at a lower level become less desirable to pick out from the box due to the amount of grinding you'd need to do to make them usable at later portions of the game.

In Xenoblade, you end up with more blades then you use as well, however there is a smart mechanic which takes advantage of your excess blades, merc missions. As you play through the game, you can form your excess blades into squads and send them out on missions. This gives many rewards including money, items, quest completion, and trains your excess blades up. This means if you get a new blade which is a bit weak for your current party set-up, you can leave it on merc missions while you play through the game and it will be up to scratch eventually. 

This is something I believe would really benefit Pokémon to have. Many players have massive amounts of Pokémon in their boxes which go untouched. Having a mechanic which allows them to be taken advantage of would massively benefit the game.

#3. Cinematics

Sun and Moon attempted to be a lot more cinematic than the previous entries. Oblique camera angles, more scripted visual animation, and longer 'cut-scenes'. 

This has had mixed results and this is somewhat controversial for Pokémon fans.

One thing I think that they could learn from Xenoblade, is that if they're going down the cinematic story route, it should be all or nothing. Fully animated cutscenes with voiced dialogue. The problem with it just looking like the overworld + text boxes is that it just feels like the game is being put on hold. If you have voiced dialogue and separate animation, you are telling the story at a much more tolerable pace and opening the doors for more visual and emotional impact. The story should be as intriguing as the gameplay. Have these as separate elements that mix well. 

I understand there's some mixed feelings for some about Xenoblade's localisation/voices/story/characterisation but these are issues separate from the structure, which is what I'm talking about here.

Why does it have it?

The reason why Regigigas got slow start was to balance it. But why? Literally no legendary Pokemon before, afterwards, or even introducing the same generation had gotting an ability to ""balance"" them. If anything it seems like they've been making legendaries more powerful with the Kyurem fusions, perfect Zygarde, and don't get me started with Ultra necrozma and especially Mega Rayquaza.

A possible reason for why it got this ability is because it was stasis for a long time. But even then that wouldn't really make a lot of sense considering that a lot of legendaries Pokemon were stasis at one point the too obvious examples I can think of being Reshiram and Zekrom who reverted to the light and dark stone respectively until the hero of either truth or ideals can call upon them.

I just beat Pokémon Black for the first time and here’s my story, I figure that some of you would like it or be inspired by it.

⚠️ Long read ⚠️ 

I have been playing Pokémon since the OG when I was in primary school.
I only played first gen, completely skipped 2 and 3 and got back in the franchise with Platinum (I think it’s my favorite). I went on to get each new remake or release but I never really beat any of them as I started to get bored or get lost along the way.

I have time to kill lately and my goal was to play on challenge mode with my white 2.

For that I went to my GameStop and got a beat version of black 2 that I used to transfer the key in my White 2. 
However I recently learned about memory link and didn’t want to miss some of the story so I decided to start by beating Black first.
(I erased a long time ago my original saved where I was at the victory road, I remembered that as I was playing: too bad as I remembered having a lot of event pokes unlocked). 

I know a lot of people say it’s better to stick to the same version (Black/Black2) but I don’t agree as you have different pokes to chose from (different exclusives). I know I’ll get to Reshiram but it’s ok I’ll put one in the GTS for a Zekrom!

The plan was to go through the game as fast as I could and not spoil much of the content (since I wanted to focus on White 2) so I followed only the essential path and skipped as much as I could (including trainers on the routes).

This part was actually pretty dumb of me because it didn’t make me gain any time but lose some. I ended up struggling A LOT on the first three or four gyms and I was under leveled most of the time. So lessons learned I guess.

I really enjoyed the story and I liked to play with the two legendaries in my team. I know it’s controversial but I enjoyed it. I never done it before and it’s dumb to spend all that effort catching them and never put them to use. I liked the fact that the story kinda pushes you to use them.

I wished they didn’t discontinue the online for this game as playing without game sync kills some pokes that are useless without their hidden abilities :(

The e4 was very though for me. Ghetsis was a very difficult fight. I had to use a lot of items.

I managed to beat the game in 29h with 131 seen and 35 caught.

My final party was as follows
- Reshiram: only used for two battles but I enjoyed him
- Whimsicott “Scott”: one of my MVP since Pinwheel. Was EXTREMELY useful and got me out of tight situations. Got boxed at some point but managed to come back from the PC. Pretty sad I replaced stun spore with poison spore though. 
- Zebstrika “Zebbie” : caught on route 7 at 33 because I was SO WEAK and I needed some punch. Helped a lot.
- Druddigon “Scarlett” : Same as above. Was one of my top mons in the end of the game.
- Tornadus : caught him as soon as I could with the Master Ball. I needed some punch for the E4. 
- Klang “Tork” : really surprised me. At first I was like “this is stupid and the ability is even stupider” however he WRECKED the ice gym and stayed strong. Gear grind is no joke.

I only caught/used the following:
- Tepig “Chop” : started, never evolved as I wanted to keep him in that stage for future trades. Retired at level 22.
- Herdier “Lillie” : served me well through the first gyms. Retired at level 23.
- Darumaka “Daru” : caught to replace Tepig. Never shined and was too weak. Boxed at 29
- Krokorok “Sacamain” : served me well. Retired at 32. Didn’t get a moxie one :(
- Scolipede “Pat” : strong mid game but ended up too under leveled. Boxed at 34
- Gigalith “Granit” : Got mid game from a wild Boldore as I was lacking in defense. Helped a lot mid game. Boxed before the last gym at 35.
- Conkeldurr “Bart” : in the team since the 2nd gym. Boxed before the last gym at 33.
- Vanillish “Dae” : tried to make it work but didn’t. Moment of shine with ice beam to kill the last dragon in the last gym though. Boxed at 35
- Purrloin “Cachou” : hommage to my first cat. Unfortunately it was way to weak compared to Lillie. Retired at 13.
- Heatmor : caught at Victory Road and was my clutch last slot during the league. Helped with maybe one or two battles.
- Unfezant “Fez” : Fly slave. Caught at level 33 because I was lazy to walk all the way back to the desert resort.

Never used (but caught):
Vullaby, Litwick, Ferroseed, Joltik, Cofagrigus, Golett, Tirtouga, Elgyem

I’ll play White 2 next in challenge mode next and intend to “100%” it with more caution and a slower pace. 
The plan is to use different pokes this time. However I’m really in love with Klang...who knows ��

Hopefully I won’t make the same mistakes.

**Butterfree** - This is the first Pokémon I ever and it's very special to me so I for sure have to keep it on my team! I caught it as a Caterpie and it literally evolved right to it's final stage so quickly before I could blink! I figure it must be super strong to evolve so fast! It's at level 49 now and knows Psybeam, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder and Whirlwind 

**Pikachu** - Okay so when I started my Journey I was going through the Viridian Forest with my starter and my Butterfree and all I was seeing was bugs everywhere but then a Pikachu appeared and I was just excited and stunned at the same time like this is so awesome but also so random! I caught it and took it as a good luck charm because like isn't Pikachu supposed to be like at a power plant or wherever you catch electric types? And I caught it in a forest.. idk it's weird. Anyway Pikachu is just iconic to Pokemon so I don't plan on evolving it. It's level 63 and knows Thunderbolt, Agility, Body Slam and Swift 

**Clefable** - Caught in Mount Moon and evolved with a moon stone and it's just soooo cute and cuddly I love it! I'm on the fence about this one though since it's been knocked out a lot in battle and probably doesn't have much confidence left although it knows a move called Metronome and it's SO cool! Literally Clefable can do any move in the entire game chosen at random!! The possibilities and endless so I really like the shock factor when my opponent wonders how Clefable used Fire Blast or Hydro Pump... it's level 60 and it's other real moves don't matter cause I only use metronome 

**Farfetch'd** - My Farfetch'd is nicknamed DUX and I don't really remember how I got it but it's my only Pokémon that knows Fly and Cut so I kinda need it... it's a little weird and Awkward but also pretty cute and a nice addition to the team... it's level 52 and also knows Agility and Slash

**Seadra** - Okay so I got this one pretty late so it's not as strong as the rest of the team. I need a water type to literally advance further in the game and the best I could find was a Poliwhirl who I never grew to like, just too weird... I found Horsea in Seafoam Islands and it's since evolved into Seadra. It's level 45 and knows Surf, Double Team, Leer and Ice Beam

**Persian** - Okay get this... when I caught this as a Meowth it knew an attach called Pay Day which literally gives you Pokémon  money every time you use it! That is insane. I have so much money right now just from using this move alone. I know this won't help me in the elite four though so i'm considering looking for a replacement.  It's level 55 and knows Pay Day, Screech, Slash and Bubble Beam for some reason 

I mean I think I have a strong team? I've tried to pick the cute ones more than anything to be honest. I had to ditch my starter because it's final evolution looked like an angry caesar salad and I didn't want it anymore.  But i've also struggled to beat gyms and get through the Silph Co and Victory Road so any recommendations are appreciated.

I’ve loved every Pokémon game I’ve played since I was  little.  Sure I have a few complaints here and there but overall I love each and every one.  When it was revealed that the Pokémon series was coming to the switch last year I was ecstatic!  My hype was through the roof and I couldn’t wait to see what Gamefreak had to show!  But then Pikachu and Eevee were announced, and I wasn’t impressed.  I wasn’t too upset at first, but over the months they started revealing details about the game.  No wild battles, Kanto Pokémon only, no abilities, no held items.  My opinion on these games soured quickly.

But it shouldn’t be that way!!

Why can’t I love these games like I loved XY and S/M?
I try so hard to be optimistic but every time I turn around another feature I loved like breeding is being taken away from me.  I want to love these games but I hate Pokémon Go mechanics and the gym requirements.

I want to love these games but I can’t.
Why can’t I?
 
It shouldn’t be like this.  I should love these games like I loved Black and White.  I’ve loved every Pokémon game so far and I should love these too but I don’t like what I’m seeing so far.

I HATE the fact that they locked Mew behind a paywall.

Sometimes I feel better about them, the graphics are pretty at least, but most times I seriously dislike them.

I tried to preorder Let’s Go Pikachu but everything inside me was SCREAMING at me to not preorder it.
Constantly reminding me that if I buy this game I’m telling Gamefreak this is what I want the future of Pokémon to look like.  And I definitely don’t. Because if future Pokémon games are just like this I won’t love them anymore.

I feel like Gamefreak is abandoning me...

Please, tell me what you like about these games.  Help me love them so when future games are just like this I can love them too.

If you read this far then thank you.  I’m being torn apart by this, I could really use the help.

I’m not trying to poop on these games like others have, I honestly need help liking them.

It SHOULDN’T be like this.


TLDR-I don’t like what I’m seeing so far of LGPE, and I hate that.  I should love these games just like the others and I don’t know why I can’t.

In the original Colosseum, wild Pokemon are all but non-existent, because the Cipher syndicate has full control of the region's water and was strangling the natural environment to make a profit. In Gale of Darkness, after Cipher's COO was stripped of his power over the water supply, life began returning to the region, and we already had hardy wild Pokemon species returning to the natural oases.

* Gligar
* Trapinch
* Hoppip

What I'd like to do is imagine what species might have an easy time acclimating to Orre, especially as green keeps returning. Here are the ideas I've had so far, lemme know if you have suggestions of your own or questions on my picks. Bearing in mind that Orre is (loosely) based off Arizona, with big name landmarks including Mt. Battle, a truly massive volcano, Citadark Isle, an abandoned evil lair that is definitely haunted now, huge amounts of badlands surrounded by plateaus and fascinating rock formations, and likely a massive fossil record with the whole area being awash in sea millions of years prior.

My teams are going to be based around whatever the competitive scene ends up looking like for the new games. I predict VGC-esque double battles will become a fairly popular competitive format, so my teams are tailored to double battles, but if singles become the go-to format, I can adapt my movesets to that.

You don’t have to get into it as far as natures and moves like I do. I just wanted to be a little extra in that regard.

I’ll start with my Let’s Go Pikachu team. It’s the easiest one to go over because I’m going to play through the game as Red (assuming these are remakes and Red isn’t a character already in the game, because that would be odd), so that includes the following:

- Pikachu

Nature: Timid/Naive

Moveset.

-Thunderbolt

-Splishy Splash

-Nuzzle

-Protect/Volt Switch

- Lapras

Nature: Quiet

Moveset:

-Ice Beam

-Hydro Pump

-Freeze-Dry

-Icy Wind/Ice Shard/Protect

- Snorlax

Nature: Brave/Adamant

Moveset:

-Body Slam

-Crunch/Earthquake

-Rest

-Sleep Talk

- Venusaur

Nature: Modest

Moveset:

-Giga Drain/Energy Ball

-Sludge Bomb

-Sleep Powder

-Protect/Hidden Powder (Fire/Ice)

- Charizard -&amp;gt; Mega Charizard X

Nature: Jolly

Moveset:

-Flare Blitz

-Dragon Claw

-Thunder Punch/?

-Protect

- Blastoise

Nature: Modest

Moveset:

-Scald

-Ice Beam

-Dark Pulse/Flash Cannon

-Protect

For Let’s Go Eevee, I have the full freedom to pick what I want, since I’m not restricting myself to Red’s team. I’ve got two slots still open that I have about seven different Pokémon to pick from, more on that later, first I’ll cover the four I do have “locked in”.

- Eevee

Nature: Jolly/Timid (not sure if new moves are physical, special, or if they’re all different)

Moveset:

-Return

-Sizzly Slide

-Bouncy Bubble

-Protect

- Dewgong

Nature: Calm

Moveset:

-Ice Beam

-Toxic

-Perish Song

-Protect

- Magmar

Nature: Modest

Moveset:

-Flamethrower/Heat Wave

-Focus Blast

-Hidden Power (Ice)

-Protect/Psychic

- Dragonite

Nature: Jolly

Moveset:

-Dragon Claw

-Extreme Speed

-Dragon Dance

-Protect

The final two slots are going to go to a Clefable, Scyther, Magneton, Persian-A, Gengar, Aerodactyl, or Kangaskhan. One of the last three will be my Mega, and I haven’t decided between which will fill the last spot. I do like Persian-A for Fake Out support, but the last two slots are TBD.

Both sets of teams seem like they’d be really fun to play through the games with, regardless of whatever the competitive scene looks like. As I said before, you don’t need to go as in depth with natures and moves like I did, that was just something I did extra.",,9hpk0m,,0,,false,1540154777,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9hpk0m/what_are_your_teams_going_to_be_for_the_upcoming/,,,false,Discussion,

3. Trevenant The design is flat out great but sadly it is found relatively late into the kalos games. Also there just are so many other great grass types like Gogoat, Chesnaught and many of the older grass types available in 6th gen games that Trevenant just never fit into any of my teams.

So, I’d like to pick up either a New 2DS XL or New 3DS XL, whichever, and play through as many of the generations as possible. 

What I would like from you more dedicated fans is an understanding of the best way to do this. I’ve heard there’s supposed to be a way to bank some Pokémon from one generation to another and possibly carry of your Pokédex. As someone who has a great love for Mewtwo, not taking advantage of that seems silly. 

So with that in mind, how would you best recommend going through with this? One game per generation is the goal, save for BW/B2W2 as I understand they’re direct sequels. I have no objection playing through remakes to accomplish the same task.

People said because is a home console, but literally the first thing they did is tell everyone that this is more of a psvita 2 that comes with a gameboy player-esque dock than a full fledge console.

People said they don't want to move because 3ds is a cheap handheld, but factor in that the 3ds 7 years old, with hardware not even strong as the handheld 7 years before that, which it itself is a hardware not even on strong to beat hardware 4 years before that.

Am I supposed to just fight it a certain number of times? Do I need to train my team to level 80+ to survive a single Photon Blast? Am I supposed to lose so many times I go broke, teaching me that being a greedy capitalist that fights others for money is bad?

For real though I’m thoroughly confused. I’m apparently not allowed to use my master ball or anything else. All I can do is watch my team die then lose money.

I have forgotten a lot about the games so may need some advice.

**Equipment**

* 2 Game Boys (NOT using emulators)
* 2 games (RED and BLUE), and 
* a link cable.

(We also have Gold and Silver which we are saving for another time. We aren't actually ""going to play together"" this time, but may be useful.)

**Aims**

Fun together and pokedex completion

I really want to catch the 151 and complete my pokedex, which I never did back in the day when I was first playing RED. And I want to do it without using glitches. I'm not interested in doing a speed run; but I don't want to have to grind and restart and grind and restart too many times. The main aim is to have fun. There are several problem Pokemon.

**Challenge Pokemon:**

1. Starters: I'll restart 1 game 5 times so that we can each set out on our quests with each of the 3 starters
2. RED/BLUE exclusives: (easy to solve by trading)
3. Trade-Evolution pokemon: (easy to solve by trading)
4. Kuboto/Omayte &amp; Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan: each choose one and trade for the other
5. Eeveelutions (there is no way of getting all 3 without restarting and grinding up right?)
6. MEW?

**Questions:**

1. Any better suggestions for 1-4?
2. Is there any way of getting all three eeveelutions? without restarting and grinding all the way up to Celadon Condominiums? (if not I may need to do that FIRST \[grindy grindy grind\], get one eevee, trade it to the other game. then  trade one eevee to one of our ""main games"" then restart, so that we can begin our quests at the same time). I could do the grinding for Eevees in Gold/Silver. Which would be faster? 
3. Is there any way of getting Mew without a glitch?
4. Have i covered all the bases? is that 151?

Personally, I just loved how it was incorporated into the storyline.

In Celestic Town, we learn that the lake trio have the power to balance either Dialga or Palkia. In other words, spirit balances either time or space. Because this kept Cyrus from conquering time and space for himself, he plans to write the lake trio out of that balance - to write spirit out of time and space, literally.

In Spear Pillar, he does just that - in the lake trio’s place are two chains made from technology, binding Dialga and Palkia. Up to that point, Dialga and Palkia were perceived to be rulers of the world -with their time and space making up the fabric of the universe- and now they’re being controlled by Cyrus - he’s about to take their place as the worlds’ new ruler. Just when everyone in our world is powerless against his control, a being just as powerful as Dialga and Palkia -Giratina- tears a hole from the Distortion World and pulls Cyrus in. We learn that the Distortion World keeps our world in existence, as both worlds balance each other. This means that Giratina keeps Dialga and Palkia in existence. The so-called “rulers” of the world, turns out, rely on a banished Pokemon just to remain in existence; and our world, full of life, relies on a world that’s barren and desolate. It’s a balance between deity and outcast; life and nothingness, where neither one is more important than the other, because they both need each other to remain in existence. Cyrus couldn’t make the world disappear with Dialga and Palkia, because they themselves were only *one* side of it; rather than the ruler of its’ entirety.

This shows that everyone (and everything) is of equal value - there is no true “ruler” of the world (contrary to what Cyrus thinks); where one is more important than everyone else. Giratina may be banished, but it’s just as important as Dialga or Palkia. The Distortion World may be barren, but it’s just as important as our world. Cyrus may have dismissed the lake trio’s importance (as well as everyone with a spirit), but Dialga and Palkia need them just as much as they need *them*; as both time and space would be completely meaningless without spirit. All these things’ equal importance is why they balance each other.",,9d6z86,,0,,false,1540078674,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9d6z86/a_deeper_side_to_sinnohs_lore/,,,false,Discussion,

For  me it started with those special cards. Not the Trading Card Game  cards, but those pokedex cards with the pointy corners. Later came  stickers and soon after the anime. The gaming begann when I got a  gameboy advance and with it my Silver version. This is basically how I  started. Later on my fervor was revived again, when I played Pokémon  Black and could relive that exitement of walking through a new region  for the first time and having all those new pokémon.

What was your first pokémon experience? What do you think?

Anyway, have a nice day :-)

I however, have noticed, that every Tumblr who does Pokemon Headcanons (I follow a lot), say that bug types are in fact oversized invertebrates with the organs that their real counterparts have. Bug types have confused me a lot in general. 

They were clearly based off invertebrates, obviously. But they're also very big, even Joltik is big for a bug, and most of them seem to have a body structure more like a vertebrate (Scolipede seems more like a horse than a centipede, and a lot of bugs have a humanoid-ish body like Volbeat, Illumise, and Leavanny). I was debating on whether they were invertebrate or vertebrate from like 2015 until this year, I mean most of their structures really lean towards vertebrates honestly but again they're bugs so I would still like to think they could just be oversized invertebrates.

This year, I finally made my choice. **Bug types are in fact vertebrates, to me at least.** I in fact think possibly all of the bug types ~~definitely not Shedinja, it's still a shell~~ are vertebrates, as I said before most of them seem to have a vertebrate body structure, and even the ones that don't are too big. Some people explain the size of bug types is because the Pokemon world has tons of oxygen, allowing for bigger bugs (the same thing happened on Earth like 300 million years ago when there was tons of oxygen in the atmosphere and land arthropods got big), but I still think they are more likely vertebrates due to so much evidence. I think they have all the vertebrate organs, and they all have bony skeletons (along with most of them having that hard exoskeleton). They just convergent evolved the invertebrate features, making them seem like insects. I wouldn't describe what exact type of vertebrate they would be, but seeing as most live on land, definitely something related to the mammal, bird, and reptile Pokemon. Maybe reptile since Flygon, a dragon-like creature, is in the bug egg group.

I'm sorry if I'm wrong on this, I think I possibly am, I haven't looked at much of the Pokemon stuff in the games or anime despite myself still being into Pokemon (wow, dumb me). Most people would probably disagree with me, if you do it's okay I'll respect your opinion, this is what I think. Some would argue that the reason why bug Pokemon would have so much vertebrate features is because every Pokemon is humanized and made familiar for the audience, well those features overly showed to me and meant a lot to the Pokemon, even I couln't ignore them. Even though most people who do Pokemon biology say bug types are oversized invertebrates, weirdly enough most of my friends say bug types do seem like vertebrates.",,9dasfh,,0,,false,1540080451,false,self,t5_2qmeb,,discussion,,false,true,,/r/pokemon/comments/9dasfh/bug_pokemon_are_actually_vertebrates_that/,,,false,Discussion,
